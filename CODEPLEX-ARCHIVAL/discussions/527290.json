(also 2008R2)\r<br />\n<br />\nThe Replica-Server works fine, and all Certs are installed correctly, but if I connect with the WPP-Console (installed on the Main-Server) to the Replica-Server the paths of the packages are pointing to the Main-Server. \r<br />\n<br />\nDoes this mean that clients which pick their updates from the Replica-Server will get their WPP-Packages from the Main-Server? <br />\n",
