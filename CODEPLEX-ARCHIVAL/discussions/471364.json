But we want to make sure that if a user has manually installed a NEWER version of a program \r<br />\n<br />\nFor example, our users are running Adobe Reader Ver 7. I create a Package to install Ver 8, however, some users have manually installed Ver 9. Will the package fail on the machines that are running version 9, or will it remove version 9 and put version 8 on instead?\r<br />\n<br />\nI did a quick test and noticed that the package appears on my install list, but whenever i do the install i get the error 80070643\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks<br />\n",
