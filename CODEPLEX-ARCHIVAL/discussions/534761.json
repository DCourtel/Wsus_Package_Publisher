E.G  Test computer A:  installs flash MSI. Report says Installed and green.  2 days later the update is back and it is showing as failed!\r<br />\nI have tried to uninstall flash and run it again.  But the update fails.\r<br />\n<br />\nI have downloaded flash from Adobe over the internet and it installs fine. But it still is trying to install the update.  It seems that it is not checking if the update is required or not and keeps sending it out regardless.<br />\n",
