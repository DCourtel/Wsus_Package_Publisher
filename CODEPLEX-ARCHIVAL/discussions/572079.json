    "Html": "Hi everybody,<br />\n<br />\nI searched for a method to install .net Framework 4.0 on Windows 7 Clients for a software which I push with a GPO. This Software (Viscosity for VPN) requires .net 4.0 Framework.<br />\n<br />\nI tried to make a MSI-File out of the .net Exe. But it didn't worked. I also found the answer in the internet, that you can't install .net 4.0 via GPO.<br />\n<br />\nSo I made a Start up Script which is working, but that's not a satisfied method. So I went on with my search and found the WPP.<br />\n<br />\nThe installation was directly on the WSUS succesful. I tried to create a &quot;custom update&quot; - but always when I push it to the WSUS and let the WSUS pushing it out, my Test Client which tries to install the update is failing.<br />\n<br />\nWindows Update just says &quot;Failure Code FFFC&quot;.<br />\n<br />\nI'm not sure what you need, here is my XML which belongs to this custom update package:<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n&lt;CustomUpdate&gt;<br />\n&lt;Action&gt;<br />\n&lt;ElementType&gt;CustomUpdateElements.ExecutableElement&lt;/ElementType&gt;<br />\n&lt;PathToExecutable&gt;C:\\Program Files\\WSUS Package Publisher\\dotNetFx40_Full_x86_x64.exe&lt;/PathToExecutable&gt;<br />\n&lt;Parameters&gt;/q /norestart&lt;/Parameters&gt;<br />\n&lt;KillProcess&gt;True&lt;/KillProcess&gt;<br />\n&lt;TimeBeforeKilling&gt;10&lt;/TimeBeforeKilling&gt;<br />\n&lt;Variable/&gt;<br />\n&lt;/Action&gt;<br />\n&lt;/CustomUpdate&gt;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nAny suggestion? I hope you can help me out, I'm tired of searching another method for deploying that .net....<br />\n<br />\nGreetings<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nEDIT:<br />\nI also created a GPO with the two Cert's succesfully. Certification is IMHO not the problem.<br />\n",
