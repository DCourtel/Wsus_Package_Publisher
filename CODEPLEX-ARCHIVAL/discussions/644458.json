Has anyone got any custom updates deploying yet to any?\r<br />\n<br />\nI get &quot;Error 0x80070643&quot; for 2 custom updates that work fine for Windows 7 SP1 , 2008 R2 and 2012 R2. The custom updates are just making registry and service changes.\r<br />\n<br />\nFor now I'm going to validate the target Windows version for the installed/installable rules but I will need to find a fix at some point as we start getting more machines with this OS.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks\r<br />\nMark<br />\n",

The GP then has some WMI filtering enabled so it only runs on the correct machines:\r<br />\n<br />\n<strong>For windows 10</strong>\r<br />\nroot\\CIMv2\r<br />\nselect * from Win32_OperatingSystem where Version like &quot;10.%&quot;\r<br />\n<strong>Windows 8.1</strong>\r<br />\nselect * from Win32_OperatingSystem where Version like &quot;6.3%&quot;\r<br />\n<br />\n The BAT file's for us one for 8.1 and one for windows 10 had the following commands which point to the extracted sxs folder for each source ISO:\r<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Windows 10</strong>\r<br />\nDism /online /enable-feature /featurename:NetFX3 /All /Source:&quot;\\SERVER\\ISO\\OperatingSystems\\Windows10 Enterprise x64\\SW_DVD5_WIN_ENT_10_64BIT_English_MLF_X20-26061\\sources\\sxs&quot; /LimitAccess\r<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Windows 8.1</strong>\r<br />\nDism /online /enable-feature /featurename:NetFX3 /All /Source:&quot;\\SERVER\\ISO\\OperatingSystems\\Windows 8.1\\SW_DVD9_SA_Win_Ent_8.1_64BIT_English_-3_MLF_X19-84068\\sources\\sxs&quot; /LimitAccess\r<br />\n<br />\nThen on login the missing feature is installed and like magic the custom WPP updates will work a treat.\r<br />\n<br />\nI hope this is of some use to other newbs to WPP like me setting this up for the first time,\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks\r<br />\nMark<br />\n",

I've only had to deploy it to half a dozen so far using the above command and only this morning did it get enabled in GP for what must be another dozen machines. I think any servers that we need to do we will do manually etc.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks\r<br />\nMark<br />\n",
