The only thing I can't get to work is the following:\r<br />\n<br />\nOur users don't have local admin rights on the clients, so the updates are installed by another user in the background.\r<br />\nI have to delete a file under the %appdata% folder of the current user. I'd like to use the &quot;Allow to Copy, Delete or Rename Files&quot; action for this. The problem is, that if I run that it wouldn't delete the file in the direction of the current user, but in the one of the administrator.\r<br />\n<br />\nIs there any way to archive deleting of files in that directory by WPP?\r<br />\n<br />\nGreets.<br />\n",
