Also when I choose to add the 'OR' clauseto add the x64 it just puts the rules one by one inside the main AND tag like this: <br />\n&lt;bar:Processor Architecture=&quot;9&quot;/&gt;<br />\n&lt;bar:Processor Architecture=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;<br />\n<br />\nNext try was with version 16.0.0.287. This time I did not put any rules in the &quot;IsInstallable&quot; section and got the same &quot;Not applicable&quot; message 3 days after approving it for all clients.<br />\n<br />\nAny thoughts?<br />\n",
