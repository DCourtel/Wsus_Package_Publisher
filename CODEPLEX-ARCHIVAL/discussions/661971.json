Now Approval is &quot;Install&quot;.<br />\n<br />\nHow do you make exception for one computer (which should not receive an update), which belongs to group for there is an approval? I have several exceptions for single computers and creating a second group for which Approval is denied does the trick in the past. Or dou i have to reorganize my WSUS groups?<br />\n<br />\nbye<br />\nHannes<br />\n",

( Flash, Reader, Firefox  ...)\r<br />\nIf I generate a new Flash player update, I approve the update only to group &quot;Flash&quot;.  If the client isnt part of group &quot;Flash&quot;, he doesnt get it.  Finish. But ofcourse its possibe to be member of group &quot;Reader&quot; or anything else. So it is not nessasary to create exeptions.\r<br />\n<br />\nI dont know why  your update status was &quot;not approved&quot; in the past. In my opinion he must be &quot;approved&quot;, if the client is in one approved group.<br />\n",
