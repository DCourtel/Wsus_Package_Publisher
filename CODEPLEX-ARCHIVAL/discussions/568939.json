My preferred method have been a Registry Value “SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\DevDiv\\vc\\Servicing\\11.0\\RuntimeMinimum\\Install” or &quot;SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\DevDiv\\vc\\Servicing\\11.0\\RuntimeMinimum\\Install&quot; equally 1 (I’ve also tried 00000001), specifying REG_DWORD. \r<br />\n<br />\nAlthough it’s an exe, rather than MSI, I’ve also tried the MSI codes from the registry.\r<br />\n<br />\nNeither method seems to work, with the installs being available no matter what, any ideas or hints please?<br />\n",
