    "Html": "We have an issue where all our clients are public IP's, but our internal domain name is different from the external DNS record, which puts all clients in a offline status for remote commands.\r<br />\n<br />\nFor example domain name for client1 is client1.domain.local.  External DNS is client1.university.edu.\r<br />\n<br />\nIf I change the hosts file on the WSUS server to represent the external DNS record of a client the remote commands work.  Obviously, this is a workaround.\r<br />\n<br />\nIs it possible to have WPP detect the external DNS record of the IP Address versus the internal domain name of the Computer Name?<br />\n",

I take it you don't have VPN's to those remote machines and they are accessing WSUS via a public DNS record and NAT also?\r<br />\n<br />\nJust trying to get an understanding of your setup.<br />\n",
