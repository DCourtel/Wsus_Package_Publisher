    "Html": "First of all a big thanks to developers, for the great product, thanks to anyone who contributes to this board and thanks to DParks256 for posting a guide for Java 7.<br />\n<br />\nI have finally started deploying Java 8 in our network, and decided share this short guide that I've created for internal use.<br />\nIt's nothing new, but a good step by step manual on how to publish Java 8 using WPP. Any feedback is welcome.<br />\n<br />\nAlso, FYI, I've test deployed Java 8 Update 31 MSI on our XP machines, and so far it works without issues, with the apps that we need it for.<br />\n<br />\nMy current MSI installation command looks like this:<br />\n<br />\nmsiexec /i jre1.8.0_XX.msi JU=0 JAVAUPDATE=0 AUTOUPDATECHECK=0 RebootYesNo=No WEB_JAVA=1 /q /norestart /log C:\\JavaInstall.log<br />\n<br />\nThe guide<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Extract MSI from EXE:<br />\n•\tRun the Java Installation executable, don't need to install<br />\n•\tGo to C:\\Users\\&lt;yourusername&gt;\\AppData\\LocalLow\\Sun\\Java\\ and copy your version's MSI file to some dedicated work folder/location.</li>\n<li>Read MSI ProductCode using WPP's MSI-reader function and copy it to a text file in a work folder.

If deploying 32bit and 64bit versions of Java and if Itanum machines report to your WSUS, then you can add the “Processor Architecture” rule. You should also be able to use Reverse rule for Processor Architecture = Architecture IA64 (not equal to Itanium) if you want to just skip IA64 machines. If you are deploying either just 32bit or just 64bit version across the board then you can leave this section alone.
