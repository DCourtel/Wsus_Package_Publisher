If you need to make change on a custom update, you must delete it and re-create it. This is the big back draw of this feature, I'm aware of that. I need to work on this. And offer the ability to revise such update and by this, to change custom actions.<br />\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>\nIn a manner similar to what we find in rules, is there a way to configure the registry actions (key or value) to be 32-bit only?<br />\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\nOnce again, it's not possible... for now. The work around is to make two updates :<br />\n<ul>\n<li>One for x86 with 'Normal' registry key/Value</li>\n<li>\nOne for x64 where you put explicitly 'Wow6432Node' in the reg key.<br />\n</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>\nAs a follow-on to the registry question, is there a way to direct file operations to the x86/SysWOW64 areas of the filesystem?<br />\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\nI have to answer same thing than above :-(<br />\n",
