    "Html": "Hey guys,\r<br />\n<br />\ni just started using the WPP to deploy Adobe Flash Player Updates. I imported the catalog to WPP without problems. After that i configured WSUS to make the Adobe Updates visible in WSUS. I approved the Adobe Updates in WSUS to be installed on clients. So until that everything works like it should be. The self signed cert is published correctly to the clients, too. \r<br />\nUnfortunately the Adobe Updates do not show up on the Client when i am searching for updates. Windows Updates from WSUS are working without any problems. Does anyone havve an idea what could be my problem or where i could have made a mistake. \r<br />\n<br />\nRegards,\r<br />\nFlorian<br />\n",
