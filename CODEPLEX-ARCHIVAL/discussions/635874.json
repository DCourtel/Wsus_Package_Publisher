But of cause we have the &quot;please use the newst driver, bios etc.&quot;\r<br />\n<br />\nSo this project is maybe the solution for all my problems.\r<br />\n<br />\nI have imported the Dell PC catalog (DellSDPCatalogPC.cab) - and everything works! But when I try to import the server catalog (DellSDPCatalog.cab) then the file is reable, but if I select example a BIOS for a server, then I gets &quot;Error when importing Update&quot; - Anybody knows about this?\r<br />\n<br />\nThe funny thing is that if I try the same job in SCUP2011 - then SCUP asks me to import a Dell certificate - but the import are working!\r<br />\n<br />\nAny help?<br />\n",
