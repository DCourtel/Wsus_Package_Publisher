Planning on deploying shortly to our organization. <br />\n<br />\nWanted to clear up 1 assumption before mass deployment. <br />\n<br />\nIf I self-sign a certificate it will expire in 5 years.  After certificate expires assuming steps are as follows.<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Generate a new certificate with WPP</li>\n<li>Configure WPP to use new cert.</li>\n<li>Use the &quot;Resign&quot; option in WPP to sign all existing update with new cert.  \n</li>\n<li>\nDeploy the new certificate to clients and replica server.<br />\n</li>\n</ol>\nIf there is an easier way to skip any of the step or renew the certificate I'm missing?  <br />\n<br />\nThanks,<br />\n",
