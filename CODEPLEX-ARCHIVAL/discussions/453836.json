Adobe 11.0.3 can be installed over 11.0.0 without installing 11.0.1 and/or 11.0.2 before. Carefully note that it is not always possbile. For example 11.0.2 <strong>CANNOT</strong> be installed over 11.0.0, but only over 11.0.1.\r<br />\n<br />\nTo do that.<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Make a Custom Update</li>\n<li>Add a Variable Element (type Int)</li>\n<li>Add a Execute file Element pointing to MsiExec and refering to the Adobe MSI file.</li>\n<li>Add a Wait Element ( 30 seconds)</li>\n<li>Add a Execute file Element pointing to MsiExec and refering to the Adobe MSP file, set the return code to the Variable Element.</li>\n<li>Add a Wait Element (30 Seconds)</li>\n<li>\nReturn the Code store in the Variable Element.<br />\n</li>\n</ul>\nSee the documentation for more d√©tails on <a href=\"https://www.codeplex.com/Download?ProjectName=WsusPackagePublisher&amp;DownloadId=684389\" rel=\"nofollow\">Custom Updates</a><br />\n",
