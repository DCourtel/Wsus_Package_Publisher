Can I still use the package publisher and WSUS to deploy custom packages if I skip the remote administration configurations on domain computers? I want to use this product to enable deployment of, for example, Adobe Reader, with WSUS but I do not want to open up the remote administration parts of package publisher.\r<br />\n<br />\nRegards,\r<br />\nUrmas<br />\n",

Such configuration is need only for extra features like sending 'DetectNow', 'ReportNow', 'install This update', 'Show windows update log' ...\r<br />\nIf you only need to publish package, you don't need to touch your firewall. \r<br />\nNote : The column &quot;Online&quot; may indicate &quot;No&quot; for all computers if computers are not enable to respond to ping request.<br />\n",
