I have the same configuration ( Server + WSUS ) , and it is not nessasary to manipulate or creating rules if you use the extracted .msi<br />\n<blockquote>\nI also tried the MSI file using a standard package insted of a custom package with even worse results.<br />\n</blockquote>\nOk. You get the the same result with the simpe .msi and the custom .msi + .mst . So, it is a more basis installation problem<br />\nWhat is happen if you start the msi manual on the client. Runs correct without interaction? <br />\n<blockquote>\nI'll be happy to provide any settings/configurations required to help troubleshoot this, as I'm sure I'm missing something, but just can't figure it out.<br />\n<br />\nThanks,<br />\n</blockquote>\nYes....<br />\nok, first... If you test your deployment, be sure that clients are clean, without old Java Installations and a clean registry. You dont want to have trouble with old offline / online  and modificated installations from Java 7 - today.<br />\n<br />\nSecond. Deployment of .msi is recommended, and a little bit more comfortable like .exe deployment, and give you the possibillity to make configurations for your installation and deinstallation.<br />\n<br />\nThere is a tutorial and more information on my site based on JAVA 8 and LUP, but its the same in WPP. Im sorry, only in german, but your Name is Kurt,  hmmm :-)<br />\nfor .msi :<br />\n<a href=\"http://road-books.jimdo.com/2014/12/01/verteilung-von-java-8-umstieg-von-java-7-mit-local-update-publisher/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://road-books.jimdo.com/2014/12/01/verteilung-von-java-8-umstieg-von-java-7-mit-local-update-publisher/</a><br />\nfor .exe ( not recommended ):<br />\n<a href=\"http://road-books.jimdo.com/2014/12/03/exe-verteilung-von-java-8-mit-local-update-publisher/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://road-books.jimdo.com/2014/12/03/exe-verteilung-von-java-8-mit-local-update-publisher/</a><br />\n<blockquote>\nKurt<br />\n</blockquote>\nIf I understand correctly, it works for 1-2 Clients, so it isnt a WPP problem or publishing problem.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n80131700 is  ERROR_INSTALL_FAILURE , so Installation start and failed. Why? Hm.<br />\n<br />\n good luck,<br />\nPÃ¶<br />\n",
