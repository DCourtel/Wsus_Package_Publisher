I have successfully setup and implemented WSUS Package Publisher, it is quite nice and I wonder why I haven't deployed this product before.\r<br />\n<br />\nI do have a question regarding best practice. Currently I have my applications packaged as a silent exe installer (<a href=\"http://www.msfn.org/board/topic/101552-7z-sfx-modified-module-and-tools/\" rel=\"nofollow\">created with 7-zip</a>) which installs the application but then performs quite a few additional steps such as creating/deleting files, registry keys, etc.\r<br />\n<br />\nSo my questions is this, is there any benefit to creating a custom update in WSUS Package Publisher or can I just continue to use the silent exe installers and import as a regular update?\r<br />\n<br />\nCheers!<br />\n",
