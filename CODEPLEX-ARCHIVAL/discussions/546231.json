I am totally new and have to learn very much.\r<br />\n<br />\nI Installed my WPP right and got it working with the Certificates etc.\r<br />\n<br />\nI delopyed Flash player 13.0.214 without any prolbems (also without many settings... it just worked)...\r<br />\n<br />\nNow i try to deploy Java 7 Update 55. I use the 7 Update 21 pdf ... but my java 7 doesnt install.\r<br />\n<br />\nFirst i tryed the Java SDK - that worked. But IE doesnt use this, so i want to install the JRE - but here my testclient hangs somewhere. I also tryed without the uninstaller, but it doesnt work.\r<br />\n<br />\nI get the stuff like in the pdf. My client detects it, but then he updates for ca. 1 hour... and fails. Maybe after all timeouts are gone.\r<br />\n<br />\nI also dont know sure where to find procukt codes... i think these are right?\r<br />\nJava 7 55 32 bit: 4EA42A62-D930-4AC4-784B-F238120755FF\r<br />\nJava 7 55 64 bit: 4EA42A62-D930-4AC4-784B-F268140755FF\r<br />\n<br />\nThats what my reg keys are called. there is also an entry in this regkey with Productkey - but its an oter thing without the Versions at the last patterns. so i think that postet bevore should be the right keys.\r<br />\n<br />\nIs there any handful way to find these keys? without installing and registry checking?\r<br />\n(maybe a tool or something...)\r<br />\n<br />\nAlso my clients have serveral versions of Java installed, i would like to uninstall all older versions, but i dont know how.\r<br />\n<br />\nWith the Acrobat Reader 11.0.7 i cannot find a msi-file at the ftp servers. \r<br />\n<br />\nI would be very thankfull if someone makes me a howto like the pdf's for my problems.\r<br />\n<br />\nSorry for my bad english.\r<br />\n<br />\nGreetings<br />\n",

I think this command should work.<br />\n<pre><code>AdbeRdr11007_en_US -nos_o&quot;C:\\Folder&quot; -nos_ne</code></pre>\n\nOnce you have the MSI file you can create a MST transform according to the PDF guide.

Here you will find Catalogs are shipped with WPP.

Did the installation failed at each client or only on one or two clients? Did the manuelly installation works?<br />\n",
