You can install WSUS on your new server as an Replica from the old one, synchronise every Content and Client to new WSUS. If all is there, you can change the new one to a Master WSUS.\r<br />\nThink about the certificate from your actual WSUS/WPP. Did you create it with WPP or with an CA?<br />\n",

There you have to change/correct the WSUS-Name.\r<br />\n<br />\nAfter creating a new certificate, you have to resigne all active packages und publish this certificate to your clients/servers.<br />\n<blockquote>\nTo your question: I created the certificate with WPP .<br />\n</blockquote>\nOK.<br />\n",
