That was the straight forward overwrite over the old one (as several post suggested).\r<br />\nThen troubles have started.\r<br />\nDue to any distribution of the executables, I always got &quot;Not approved&quot; status.\r<br />\n<br />\nI had to completely extract the previous release of WPP, we can say, to the fresh folder, to run the app.\r<br />\nThen problem is gone.\r<br />\n<br />\nWhat do I do wrong please?\r<br />\nAny suggestions please?\r<br />\nI run several W2012R2 combined with W8.1.\r<br />\n<br />\nCheers,\r<br />\nMarek<br />\n",

It is not the issue with the upgrade of overwriting of the older WPP package.\r<br />\nIt looks like the problem with Approval, or detection.\r<br />\nEverything works with the older version.\r<br />\n<br />\nAny suggestions to check please?\r<br />\n<br />\nCheers,\r<br />\nMarek<br />\n",
