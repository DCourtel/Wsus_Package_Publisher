    "Html": "Hello pthiyaga, <br />\n<br />\nFirst, ensure you make difference between :<br />\n<pre><code> * Adobe Reader : For reading PDF.\n * Adobe Acrobat : For creating PDF.\n</code></pre>\n\nSecond, &quot;Adobe Reader XI deployment guide&quot; is a special deployment procedure and you do not have to follow it. In Addition, I think that &quot;Customization Wizard&quot; does not exist for version 9 (only starting with X).<br />\n<br />\nIf a computer have already Adobe Reader or Adobe Acrobat, you can update it by deploying an .msp file (Patch file). Patch files are lighter than full files. You can download it here : <br />\n<pre><code> * [Adobe Reader](ftp://ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/reader/win/9.x/)\n * [Adobe Acrobat](ftp://ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/acrobat/win/9.x/)\n</code></pre>\n\nIf you want to deploy 9.5.4 everywhere there is a 9.5.3, leave &quot;installed rule&quot; and &quot;installable rule&quot; empty. Wsus will use .msp metadata to generate it automatically.<br />\n<br />\nOnce you have publish the update, do not approve it immediately. Select the vendor of the update in the left pane. Select the update in the upper right pane. On the &quot;Status&quot; tab, select a computers group. Select some computers in the lower right pane. Then right click on these computers and choose &quot;Send DetectNow&quot;. Wait 1 minute, to let these computers to check if they need this update. Then, on the same computers, right click and choose &quot;Send ReportNow&quot;. Wait 30 secondes, to let the server processing these answers.<br />\n<br />\nVerify, that computers who need the update, report as &quot;Not Installed&quot;. And computers that do not need this update, report as &quot;Not Applicable&quot;.<br />\n<br />\nIf you have a test group in your Wsus, approve this update for installation in this group. Wait 30 seconds, and send a &quot;DetectNow&quot;. Depending of your computers configuration, they will download and install the update or wait for the user to click to install.<br />\nOnce some computers have installed the update, check that the software work reliably.<br />\nIf you are satisfied with this update, you can apply it to other groups<br />\n<br />\nNote : 9.5 is a pretty old release. If you're talking about Adobe Reader, consider an upgrade to the latest release (11.0.2).<br />\n<br />\nIf you have any problem for publishing, testing, installing, don't hesitate to contact me.<br />\n",

(Noticed on wsus server/certificate mmc, there is a folder as &quot;WSUS&quot; under that certificate sub folder found a certificate saying &quot;WSUS Published Self signed&quot;.\r<br />\nExported the certificate and then Imported that certificate to WSUS server's &quot;Trusted Publishers&quot; and &quot;trusted root certification authorities&quot;\r<br />\n<br />\nHave a test group on wsus which has two computers (one XP and one Win 7) rather than setting up a GPO to push the certificate to those computers.

    "Html": "<blockquote>\nDo I have to download the .msp for the exact next release from what it has (9.0.0) or can I try any version msp i.e 9.2 ?<br />\n</blockquote>\nYes, MSP files are patch files. With that you can update a software from ONE version to another ONE version (for example : from 11.0.0.0 to 11.0.1.0). You will NEVER update a software from 11.0.0.0 to 11.0.1.0 on one computer and from 11.0.1.0 to 11.0.2.0 on another one computer.\r<br />\n<br />\n Don't try to update Adobe Acrobat Pro for now, because you will have licence problems.\r<br />\nLet concentrate on Adobe Reader 7.0.9 on your XP computer.\r<br />\nFirst, go to <a href=\"ftp://ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/reader/win/11.x/11.0.00/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Adobe Reader FTP</a>\r<br />\nChoose the appropriate language and download the MSI file (this is a FULL installation file. With that you can upgrade from release 7 to release 11 directly).\r<br />\nThen download release 11.0.1.0 in MSP format <a href=\"ftp://ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/reader/win/11.x/11.0.01/misc/\" rel=\"nofollow\">HERE</a>\r<br />\nThis will allow you to update release 11.0.0.0 to 11.0.1.0\r<br />\nThen download release 11.0.2.0 in MSP format <a href=\"ftp://ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/reader/win/11.x/11.0.02/misc/\" rel=\"nofollow\">HERE</a>\r<br />\n<br />\nStart WPP and publish MSI file et the two MSP files. Leave the 'installed rule' tab and the 'installable rule' tab empty. Wsus will automaticaly generate appropriate rule base on  the msi/msp code.\r<br />\n<br />\nAfter these files have been publish, wait 30 seconds to let Wsus process these update. \r<br />\nOpen a session on the XP computer. Open a command line and type : Wuauclt /DetectNow\r<br />\nWait one minute. and type Wuauclt /ReportNow\r<br />\nWait 30 seconds, and, on WPP, refresh the display. See if the XP computer show these updates has 'not installed'.\r<br />\n<br />\nYou can do the same for updating Java 7 u11 to Java 7 U17.\r<br />\nFirst go <a href=\"http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">HERE</a>\r<br />\ndownload the JRE : jre-7u17-windows-i586.exe for <strong>32bit</strong> or jre-7u17-windows-x64.exe for <strong>64bit</strong>\r<br />\n<br />\nAs this is an EXE file, the installation won't be silent if you do not add this switch /s in the command line (at the bottom of the second page when creating your update).\r<br />\n<br />\nKeep me informed of your progress.<br />\n",

Clients will evaluate installable rules and installed rules event on 'not approved' updates. This is usefull to determine if our rules are good.\r<br />\nIf some computers show as 'Installed' for Adobe that mean that the software is already installed.
