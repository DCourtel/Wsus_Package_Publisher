When a send it to the clients for downloading, there was some clients with the newest version 29.0.1 installed, and the WSUS installed the 29.0 (older that before). \r<br />\nIs there a possible rule, that says: only install the package when there isnt a newst version already installed? \r<br />\nI have tried with the rule installable when I developed 29.0.1 : &lt;bar:FileVersion Path=&quot;C:\\Program Files\\Mozilla Firefox\\firefox.exe&quot; Comparison=&quot;LessThan&quot; Version=&quot;29.0.1.5239&quot;/&gt;, like: install only if the version already installed is less than the code of version 29.0.1, but it doesnt work.\r<br />\nDoes somebody have an idea?\r<br />\nThanks in advance<br />\n",

I will be doing this as well very soon and have been pondering a few ideas...\r<br />\n<br />\nWhat seems to be the biggest pain for me at the moment is how Mozilla puts the version in the key itself\r<br />\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall\\Mozilla Firefox 28.0 (x86 en-US)\r<br />\nAnd the &quot;DisplayVersion&quot; key doesn't quite fit the format described in the &quot;Reg Sz To Version Registry Key&quot; rule type in Package Publisher which allows you to do less than &amp; greater than comparisons.\r<br />\nYou might try this rule with the &quot;MozillaMaintenanceService&quot; key which appears to share a DisplayVersion\r<br />\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall\\MozillaMaintenanceService\r<br />\n<br />\nI haven't had a chance to test this theory that it will work yet but it might do the trick for you.<br />\n",
