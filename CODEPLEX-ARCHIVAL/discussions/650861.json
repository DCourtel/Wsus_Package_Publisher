They are installing fine, but the old installations still remain.\r<br />\n<br />\nI deployed Java 8 b66 to everyonea and now b71 came out. I created a superseding update and removed the b66 and the b71 installs fine, but the b66 is still installed on the computer. So now i have a Java8 b66 and Java8 b71 installed on the computers. Previously it just upgraded it and the old build disappeared (unless it was a major update from 7 to 8).\r<br />\n<br />\nIs there a way to force it to uninstall or properly upgrade the builds within major versions?<br />\n",

Do not remove the old update in WPP, but set the update permission from &quot; Permission to install &quot; to &quot; Permission to deinstall&quot;. A new update &quot;installs&quot; on your clients an deinstall the software.\r<br />\n<br />\nA very new way, with new WPP Version 1.3.1603.29 is to create a custom update with the option &quot; deinstall MSI-Installation&quot; .<br />\n",
