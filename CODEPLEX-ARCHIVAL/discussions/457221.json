    "Html": "Java 7 Update 40 Install Notes:\r<br />\nFirst install the standard Java x86 &amp; x64 packages from Sun.\r<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp</a>\r<br />\n<br />\nObtain Cab and MSI from C:\\Users\\&lt;yourusername&gt;\\AppData\\LocalLow\\Sun\\Java (Vista/7 Directory; I forget where it is for XP, should be a quick Google search.\r<br />\n<br />\nThe jre folders therein contain the uncompressed installers; your results may be undesirable if you attempt to uncompress the jre executable installer with 7zip or winRAR and then try to use those installers to create a package; just something I ran into a while back, FYI.\r<br />\n<br />\nI use the .cab / .msi because of various errors and problems with using the I've EXEs encountered; Sun recommends using the MSI and cab like I do. Save yourself the headache and skip the EXEs; I encounter new issues with each release.\r<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.java.com/en/download/help/msi_install.xml\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.java.com/en/download/help/msi_install.xml</a>\r<br />\n<br />\nNext, get the install strings for the java release you're deploying; I have listed them for convenience, but you can see how I found them below.\r<br />\n<br />\n7u40 string:\r<br />\n{26A24AE4-039D-4CA4-87B4-2F83217040FF}\r<br />\n<br />\n7u40x64 string:\r<br />\n{26A24AE4-039D-4CA4-87B4-2F86417040FF}\r<br />\n<br />\n7u40 updater string: (Unchanged since 7u21)\r<br />\n{4A03706F-666A-4037-7777-5F2748764D10}\r<br />\n<br />\nYou can find these by using the WSUS Package Publisher and going to tools &gt; MSI Reader, loading the MSI, and going to the property table. The install string is labeled &quot;ProductCode&quot;.\r<br />\n<br />\nAlternately, if you'd rather verify strings in the registry:\r<br />\n<br />\n32-bit Install Strings Located: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall[ProductCode] \r<br />\n<br />\n64-bit Install Strings Located: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall[ProductCode] \r<br />\nBrowse through the strings until you see Java and updater codes.\r<br />\n<br />\nNow to create the package!\r<br />\nI used the guide as a template, (<a href=\"https://www.codeplex.com/Download?ProjectName=WsusPackagePublisher&amp;DownloadId=691788\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.codeplex.com/Download?ProjectName=WsusPackagePublisher&amp;DownloadId=691788</a>) so you may need to read that to fill in some gaps, but in summary here's how I built my x86 update:\r<br />\nA. Start Custom Update from WPP<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Define Return Code as in guide</li>\n<li>Stop Service JavaQuickStarterService</li>\n<li>Allow to execute a file with following strings:\r<br />\nPath to file:\r<br />\n%windir%\\System32\\msiexec.exe\r<br />\nParameters:\r<br />\n/i jre1.7.0_40.msi /quiet /norestart AUTOUPDATECHECK=0 IEXPLORER=1 JAVAUPDATE=0 JU=0\r<br />\nKill process after 15 minutes, link to &quot;Return Code&quot;\r<br />\nAdd Exit code, link to &quot;Return Code.&quot;</li>\n<li>\nYou are now done with custom update XML generator, continue on.\r<br />\nB. Add .CAB and .MSI files to the package; Mark it as an update - Critical update.\r<br />\nI mostly followed the guide from this point on, except for my install rules; for “already installed”, I used the guide, but for “installable”, I set the x86 java package to install on x86 &amp; x64 machines (since most browsers are 32-bit.) I used the not equal to Itanium CPU type rule to allow for x86 and x64 installation.\r<br />\nAlso, the x64 installer doesn't have an updater package anymore; for more information in what command line options java's MSI accepts, see the slightly outdated article from Sun:\r<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/silent-136552.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/silent-136552.html</a><br />\n</li>\n</ol>\nTo test, approve for WSUS test group. If retrying a package, or flushing a deleted test package on a test machine, you can stop the Windows Update service, delete “datastore” and “download” folder contents from local cache in C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution, then check for Windows Updates. (Leave the folders, just delete the contents.)\r<br />\nI hope you find these tips helpful; your mileage may vary. Credit: The people at WSUS Package Publisher who wrote that excellent documentation. I never would have gotten this package working right without the Documentation section.<br />\n",
