No matter what adjustments I make, I cannot get enough screen realestate to get the most out of the editor.  Lately, I find I am trying to manually build rule sets with NotePad++ and then import them into the updates I'm building.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks!<br />\n",

    "Html": "I second this request, it is very difficult to get an at a glance view of the rules you are inputting. It needs to be easier to 1.) input rules inside &quot;AND&quot; and &quot;OR&quot; sections; and 2.) have a larger working space so you can see complex nested groups. Currently, as soon as you go one or two levels deep, you lose the ability to see beyond 1 or 2 rules at a time. You have to constantly scroll to find where you are at.\r<br />\n<br />\nLastly, I believe the workflow for many of us, is that we create the rules outside of WPP (in a text editor) and then proceed to import them. If there was a way to import the XML code directly, similar to what LUP offers, that would be huge!! I hate to compare this project to LUP, since I've used both and I see the benefits in this one, but rule creation was one thing LUP did right.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks for you hard work on this project and keep up the good work!! Looking forward to v2. =]<br />\n",
