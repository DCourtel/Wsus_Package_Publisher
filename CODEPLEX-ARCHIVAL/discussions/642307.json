Users can install this Software if they want. It was working under XP - W8.1.<br />\nToday I include a W10 Prof client in our Domain, and all optional updates was install as &quot;normal&quot; updates.<br />\nWindows 10 comes with a lot of different options in the Windows Update area, it will be a good idea to upgrade your GPO with new templates first.<br />\nI think, it is because  in future &quot;optionale updates&quot; are not a part of classic windows (security) updates, it will be a part of the new update rings ( fast / slow/ LTS ).<br />\n",
