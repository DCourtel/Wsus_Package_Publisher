Because of that, I added the other set of OR options and selected Domain Controller from the list however now I am seeing that one of my non-domain controller servers are appearing as Not Installed now and all the DC's are still showing as Not Installed instead of N/A.<br />\n",

    "Html": "Sorry not really an answer to your question but I saw this and thought I would mention how we control what gets what... We use the targeting groups in group policy to control what gets what, we have the groups Workstations, Servers, Domain Controller, and some specific App_JavaInstall ones for example.\r<br />\n<br />\nWhen we approve Java it gets approved to only the Workstations targeting groups etc, we find this the best way to grannually manage what gets what.\r<br />\n<br />\nHope it helps even if its not the answer you wanted.<br />\n",
