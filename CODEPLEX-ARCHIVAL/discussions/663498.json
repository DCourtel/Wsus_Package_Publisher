When I look at the status, it shows Not Installed, Approval is set to Install and the Last Contact Date is current.\r<br />\n<br />\nWe are on Server 2008 R2 and WSUS updates are working fine.\r<br />\n<br />\nThis took me down a rabbit hole and I tried to create a package for the newest version of Reader.  When I went to publish the package, I get a CreateDirectory Failed message.  I attempted to revise one of the packages currently listed and get the same message.  This is installed on the same machine as my WSUS server.<br />\n\r<br />\nMy installation on is D: and both the UpdateServicesPackages and WsusContent folders have recent timestamps.  I am logged on the server as a Domain Admin.\r<br />\n<br />\nAny guidance is appreciated.<br />\n",
