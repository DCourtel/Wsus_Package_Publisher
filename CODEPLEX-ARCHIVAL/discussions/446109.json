It this case it is <strong>&quot;/qn ADDLOCAL=ClassicStartMenu&quot;</strong>.    Note I have confirmed the application will install using those command line options when I type them by hand.<br />\n<br />\nHowever, when I try to deploy the MSI via WSUS Package Publisher using that command line option, I get a 80070667 error on my client computers.   Researching this error suggests that their is a problem with the command line options.<br />\n<br />\nAny ideas on what I am doing wrong?<br />\n",
