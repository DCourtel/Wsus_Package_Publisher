I stumbled upon your software and have been very successful sending out my regular WU and some custom updates through my network. Way to go guys! \r<br />\n<br />\nThe only problem I am having now is I cannot get Java to install without requiring Admin rights. \r<br />\nHas any one else been successful in doing this? This is the last piece to have all of my software deploy-able without having to use the slow GPO method.\r<br />\n<br />\nThank you all and I love your work! <br />\n",
