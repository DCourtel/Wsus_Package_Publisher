We've not really used many of the other programs in the catalog but will look to over time.  I guess we've been using it for 6-9 months now.<br />\n",

This defiantly needs to be done for the Java updates.\r<br />\nOtherwise windows will assume that the install failed when in fact it succeeded.\r<br />\nDouble click on your new update and add a new line under Return Codes. Set “0” to “Succeeded”\r<br />\n&quot;<br />\n",
