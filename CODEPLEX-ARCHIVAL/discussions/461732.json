    "Html": "Hello,<br />\n<br />\nWe have all kinds of Java on our environnment (6 and 7 with different updates). We would like to use WPP to patch all of them to the lastest version (7 update 40). But we don't want the computers that don't have Java to have it installed.<br />\n<br />\nTherefore i collected all the product codes of the existing installations (31 of them) and we added a OR rule  when the update packet checks if it's installable. It goes like that:<br />\n<br />\n&lt;Start AND&gt;<br />\n&lt;lar:Not&gt;<br />\n&lt;msiar:MsiProductInstalled ProductCode=&quot;{26a24ae4-039d-4ca4-87b4-2f83217040ff}&quot;/&gt;<br />\n&lt;/lar:Not&gt;<br />\n<br />\n&lt;Start OR&gt;<br />\n&lt;bar:RegValueExists Key=&quot;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE&quot; Subkey=&quot;SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Installer\\Folders&quot; Value=&quot;C:\\Windows\\Installer{26A24AE4-039D-4CA4-87B4-2F83217013FF}&quot; Type=&quot;REG_SZ&quot;/&gt;<br />\n<br />\n&lt;bar:RegValueExists Key=&quot;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE&quot; Subkey=&quot;SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Installer\\Folders&quot; Value=&quot;C:\\Windows\\Installer{26A24AE4-039D-4CA4-87B4-2F83217011FF}&quot; Type=&quot;REG_SZ&quot;/&gt;<br />\n<br />\n... with the 31 keys<br />\n<br />\n&lt;End OR&gt;<br />\n&lt;End AND&gt;<br />\n<br />\nThe update never gets detected on machines that have a Java installed. We tried with 2 detections only (7 update 25 and 7 update 21) and the updates sometimes gets detected, sometimes not (reboots, ...). When we don't make any registry related detection, the update is always detected for installation (but as we don't want the computers without Java to install, this is not a solution for us)<br />\n<br />\nWe surely do something wrong, but i don't know anymore where to check...<br />\n<br />\nThanks in advance for your help<br />\n",
