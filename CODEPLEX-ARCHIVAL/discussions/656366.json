Now I want to upgrade all of them to the currently version 11.0.17, but Adobe has different installations for them, so I want to get rid of the MUI Installations in a custom update &quot;Adobe Reader XI (German)&quot;. Here I tried the following the without success:<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Uninstall MSI: Inputfield = GUID of Adobe MUI (AC76BA86-7AD7-FFFF-7B44-AB0000000001)</li>\n<li>\nRun MSI: msiexec.exe with the parameter: &quot;/x {[AdbeRdr11000_MUI.msi | AC76BA86-7AD7-FFFF-7B44-AB0000000001]}\r<br />\nIn both cases it just installs the german version and the MUI stays installed.<br />\n</li>\n</ul>\nIn the update itself I inserted the MSI for the German version and added a few parameters for installed and installing posible (This is working great)\r<br />\n<br />\nIs there anybody having the same issue and has a solution?\r<br />\nGreets<br />\n",
