    "Html": "After updating to the last wpp version 1.3.1407.29 I tried the <strong>Import from catalog</strong> functionality for the latest Adobe Flash Player update. I was stuck after few seconds with a &quot;Failed to Sign Package&quot; error. Google searches pointed me in the wrong direction: I simply missed the proxy configuration. I would add the error message was not very friendly.\r<br />\n<br />\nThere is still something unclear to me: how the previous version of Wpp (installed in march 2014) could detect the latest release if it didn't have the proxy configuration ? Was it lost when I overwrote the previous files with the newest ones ? \r<br />\n<br />\nIn that case it is worth to add an installation note somewhere.\r<br />\n \r<br />\nI decided to report my problem and solution here hoping it may help others.\r<br />\n<br />\nBye\r<br />\nFilippo<br />\n",

Then the publication fail.\r<br />\nIf you have the error message &quot;Failed to Sign package&quot; that mean that WPP have download something from the vendor and try to publish it.\r<br />\n<br />\nMost likely, the misconfigured proxy has authorized WPP to go through Internet (even partially).\r<br />\n<br />\nWhen WPP is upgraded, the process of upgrading options is entirely managed by the .Net Framework.<br />\n",
