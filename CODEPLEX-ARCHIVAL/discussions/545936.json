There may be a method to do this already that I have missed.\r<br />\nI am looking for a method where if a product that I already built a custom package for makes an update, to basically re-use an existing custom package, but replace the product's installation EXE/MSI files and update the rule sets.\r<br />\nI can import/export the rulesets, but I'd like to be able to export an entire update, make the changes I need and re-import.\r<br />\n<br />\nIs anything like this already in WPP or could it be added?  Thanks!<br />\n",
