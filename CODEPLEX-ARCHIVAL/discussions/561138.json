    "Html": "Not for the faint of heart .......\r<br />\nHere's how I publish Air updates when dealing with point updates like going from Adobe Air 15.0.0.293 to 15.0.0.356. I've been successful with this method with versions 13 through 15.\r<br />\n<br />\nAs others have discovered in this thread, Adobe does a piss poor job of creating MSI's that will upgrade or install over the existing version, primarily because they are using the same product code in the setup.msi. In that regard, the windows installer will think you're trying to perform a reinstall and will end up telling you that the update is not needed.\r<br />\n<br />\nThe latest version of Air (15.0.0.356) has a product code in the MSI = {7BBAEC47-1CC0-4CB8-ADB4-531B78DBD1DD}. The problem is that is the product code for all 15 versions. To get around this do the following:\r<br />\n<br />\nOpen the setup.msi using Orca, navigate to the Property Table and modify the product code by one letter, in this case changing the <strong>last letter</strong> from D to E {7BBAEC47-1CC0-4CB8-ADB4-531B78DBD1DE}, then save the setup.msi\r<br />\n<br />\nOnce that is complete, create the update. You need the setup.msi and the Adobe Air folder. Creating the update is realtively easy.\r<br />\nHere I've had plenty of trouble getting the Windows Update client to detect the update unless I make sure the <strong>Package Level rules are deleted</strong>. I do not use the MSI Product Installed detection method but rather <strong>file version</strong>.\r<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Update already installed?</strong>\r<br />\n&lt;bar:FileVersion Path=&quot;Adobe AIR\\Versions\\1.0\\Adobe AIR.dll&quot; Comparison=&quot;GreaterThanOrEqualTo&quot; Version=&quot;15.0.0.356&quot; Csidl=&quot;44&quot;/&gt;\r<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Update is installable?</strong>\r<br />\n&lt;bar:FileVersion Path=&quot;Adobe AIR\\Versions\\1.0\\Adobe AIR.dll&quot; Comparison=&quot;LessThan&quot; Version=&quot;15.0.0.356&quot; Csidl=&quot;44&quot;/&gt;<br />\n",
