I can confirm that &quot;IsInstalled&quot; and &quot;IsInstalable&quot; Rules were configured as per the documentation.\r<br />\n<br />\nAs I had problems on two machines I followed WinfriedSonntag advice for one and DCourtel advice for the other.\r<br />\n<br />\nPC1 - DCourtel:\r<br />\nI uninstalled Adobe Flash Play (I had to use the Adobe Flash Player uninstall tool to remove it completely). \r<br />\nAfter relaunching a detection the problem was no longer apparent. Flash was re-applied and a failure was no longer reported.\r<br />\n<br />\nPC2 - WinifriedSonntag:\r<br />\nAfter issuing the suggested commands the same problem was still apparent. Failure still reported.\r<br />\n<br />\nAny ideas what may have caused the initial failure?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks again<br />\n",
