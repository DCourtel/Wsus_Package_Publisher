Now I'm going to use this API in production, my company wants to use a certificate signed by our CA. We already have it, but WPP seems to only want to use its self-signed certificate.\r<br />\n<br />\nWhen I import it in mmc &gt; Certificates, then I load WPP and try to connect to my local WSUS server, it says there is no certificate.\r<br />\nIs there a way to use my certificate instead of the self-signed one? \r<br />\n<br />\nPlease let me know as quickly as you can.\r<br />\nThanks<br />\n",

This should have been taken care of by the export/import done earlier, but I haven't tested this on my end specifically. You could also distribute the intermediate cert as a trusted intermediate CA for the clients, but it's more secure to have the clients trust the root CA and send the intermediate certs to the client upon connection.<br />\n",

You need the the certificated to be in the trusted publishers store too. Thats why a codesigning certificate from a CA is in this case usually oversized. ;)\r<br />\n<br />\nRegards\r<br />\nNorbert<br />\n",

Packages needs to be sign with a code signing certificate. To be trusted, the code signing certificate must be present in the &quot;Trusted Publisher&quot; store. And the certificate of the Root Authority that have issued the code signing cert, must be present in the &quot;Root Certificate authorities&quot; store.<br />\n<blockquote>\nWhy it's not necessary to deploy a certificate on my client to install Windows updates through 8531 whereas it is for WPP?<br />\n</blockquote>\nMicrosoft updates are digitally signed, and their certificates are already in the good stores.<br />\n",
