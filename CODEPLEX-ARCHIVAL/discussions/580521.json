After creating a new certificate WPP starts without error but the 3-party-Updates can not imported/resigned.\r<br />\n<br />\nSo we used both certificates (old and new), imported the 3-party-updates and resigned them. After that we dropped the old certificate.\r<br />\n<br />\nIs there any other options when migrating WSUS to a new machine?\r<br />\n<br />\nBest regards\r<br />\nPetapico.<br />\n<pre><code>Server 2003 R2 Standard\nWSUS 3.2.7600.274\nWPP 1.3.1411.9\n\nServer 2008 R2 Standard\nWSUS 3.2.7600.251\nWPP 1.3.1411.9</code></pre>\n\n",
