I'm starting to think that wsua.exe might rely on some Windows Update process itself. So wusa can't install because you are already using Windows Update in installing the update itself. That's my guess anyway.<br />\n",

My first test went well, so I'm going to try other .msu's that I have to see if they'll work too.
