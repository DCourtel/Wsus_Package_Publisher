We installed by generating a certificate so we are stumped as to why we are receiving this error. \r<br />\nWe installed WSUS on Server 2008 R2 and will be using the publisher on the same machine. We are in the process of installing two downstream (replica) servers to update a large number of computers in our school district.\r<br />\nAny assistance would be greatly appreciated<br />\n",

So now I'm really stumped. I really would like to get this working for us. My boss didn't think it would work for us buy I told him I would give it a shot anyway. Any help you can offer is appreciated.</code></pre>\n\n/Bob<br />\n",
