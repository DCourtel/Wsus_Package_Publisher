    "Html": "Hello,\r<br />\n<br />\nFor awhile know we have been receiving the &quot;The certificate is invalid&quot; when used the WSUS Package Publisher tool, but we have been ignoring it because our certificates worked deploying MSI packages through the &quot;WSUS Package Publisher&quot; tool.    We just thought the tool didn't like using our in-house created certificates that we have been using for the past few years.\r<br />\n<br />\nThe new version of the WSUS Package Publisher displays this same error, but now it won't let us publish any new MSIs.   Is there anyway to figure out why the tool doesn't like our in-house certificates even though they work deploying MSI files?\r<br />\n<br />\nNote 1:  The &quot;Certificate Path&quot; information shows that the publishing certificate and the trusted CA are OK.\r<br />\nNote 2:  The CA certificate is installed in the &quot;Trusted Root Certificate Authority&quot; folder.\r<br />\nNote 3:  The publishing certificate is installed the &quot;WSUS&quot; and &quot;Trusted Publishers&quot; folder.<br />\n",

And this method return 'False' for your certificate while you're using it with success for Wsus. This is a strange behavior.<br />\n<br />\nThe current release do not allow users to publish update with an invalid certificate.<br />\nIn the next release, I will add an option to ignor this error. This is not a good way, but I'm not as expert as I should to solve this strange behavior. May be later...<br />\n",
