If a computer needs to be keep up to date with Flash player but not Adobe Reader, they add this computer to &quot;Flash Player&quot; group but not &quot;Adobe Reader&quot;.\r<br />\nFor doing this, you need to desactivate &quot;Client side targeting&quot; via GPO on clients computers and set the Wsus server to allow assigning computer manually (Options -&gt; Computers -&gt; &quot;Use Update Service Console&quot;)<br />\n",
