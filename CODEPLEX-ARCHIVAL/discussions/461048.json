    "Html": "I am getting ready to use wsus package publisher for the first time.  My first test package was a 32bit deployment of Java 7u40 which, after a few tweaks, was successful.  However, i created a second deployment for the 64bit systems.  It is nearly identical except for the detection id of the software.  However, my 64bit deployment is returning the 800B0109 error.  I have confirmed that the certificate is installed.  I have also rebooted the systems after the certificate was installed.\r<br />\n<br />\nCertificate installation was generated from our Domain Controller and pushed via Group Policy into the Trusted Publishers container.  Any idea why i am seeing this issue only with the 64bit systems?  I only had one 32bit system that I was testing with, but i put two 64bit systems in my test deployment and both are showing the same error.<br />\n",
