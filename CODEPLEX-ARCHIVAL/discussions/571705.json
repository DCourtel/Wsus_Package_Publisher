The Setup folder (and all its files) takes round about 1.6 GByte of disk space.\r<br />\nMy storage location for the Updates is a mapped network drive with a Gigabit network conneciton.\r<br />\nMy 2nd problem is, that I can publish the update, but it always sais &quot;Update failed to download&quot;. But I can see it in the list - what am I doing wrong?\r<br />\nThe 3rd problem is really strange: while publishing is in progress, I try to use the machine for other tasks. When WPP is in foreground, I cannot move the mouse pointer. When I try, the computer locks.\r<br />\n<br />\nRegards,\r<br />\nGeorg<br />\n",

At which step does it occurs ? Be sure to use the latest release of WPP (1.3.1411.09).<br />\n<blockquote>\nWhen WPP is in foreground, I cannot move the mouse pointer.
