It's realy amazing!!!!!!\r<br />\n<br />\nNow, I have a question about the Rules for detect and install some apps.\r<br />\nI will use Java JRE 7u17 as example.\r<br />\n<br />\nI want to install jre17x86 and jre17x64. Both editions needs to be installed on x64 machines and the x86 only on machines with x86 CPU.\r<br />\nAt the moment I have created 3 packages because I have some problems with the rules but I want to have 2 packages at least.\r<br />\n<br />\nThe problem with the both MSI package is that x86 and x64 will have the same product id. I don't know who the hell has decided this but I guess with your rules it should be possible to sort this out.\r<br />\n<br />\n<strong>3 values for the x86 package:</strong>\r<br />\n<br />\n<strong>1. (x86 and x64) - MSI ID:</strong>\r<br />\n26A24AE4-039D-4CA4-87B4-2F86417017FF\r<br />\n<strong>2. After Installing it on x64:</strong>\r<br />\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\JavaSoft\\Java Runtime Environment\\1.7.0_17\r<br />\n<strong>3. After Installing it on x86:</strong>\r<br />\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\JavaSoft\\Java Runtime Environment\\1.7.0_17\r<br />\n<br />\nNow, I will notice down an rule for this:\r<br />\n<br />\n<strong>IF exists</strong> 26A24AE4-039D-4CA4-87B4-2F86417017FF\r<br />\n<strong>AND</strong>\r<br />\n{ <strong>IF</strong> CPU = x64 <strong>AND</strong> &quot;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\JavaSoft\\Java Runtime Environment\\1.7.0_17}\r<br />\n<strong>OR</strong>\r<br />\n{ <strong>IF</strong> CPU = x86 <strong>AND</strong> HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\JavaSoft\\Java Runtime Environment\\1.7.0_17}\r<br />\n<strong>PACKAGE IS INSTALLED</strong>\r<br />\n<br />\n<strong>ELSE</strong>\r<br />\n<br />\n<strong>PACKAGE IS NOT INSTALLED</strong>\r<br />\n<br />\nI guess this rule should be right. But this will not work. Can you give me a short example to understand the rules within your tool?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks in advance!<br />\n",
