I'm using 'Installing All Java release except the latest one.pdf' from the documentation section <a href=\"https://www.codeplex.com/Download?ProjectName=WsusPackagePublisher&amp;DownloadId=1559026\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>, but am having trouble getting it to remove other versions.  I'm using the following in the 'Uninstall All Msi Product for which the Msi Product Code match...'\r<br />\n<em>26A24AE4-039D-4CA4-87B4-2F%;26A24AE4-039D-4CA4-87B4-2F8__16</em>____;3248F0A8-6813-11D6-A77B-00B0D01600___;3248F0A8-6813-11D6-A77B-00B0D015%;3248F0A8-6813-11D6-A77B-00B0D0150___;7148F0A8-6813-11D6-A77B-00B0D014%;7148F0A8-6813-11D6-A77B-00B0D0142___;4A03706F-666A-4037-7777-5F2748764D10_\r<br />\n<br />\nand the following in 'Except these one' \r<br />\n'26A24AE4-039D-4CA4-87B4-2F32180111F0;26A24AE4-039D-4CA4-87B4-2F83217021FF' \r<br />\nbut it doesn't remove version 8 update 77.\r<br />\n<br />\nIf I try the 'Remote MSI Manager' it returns the expected results.  Are there additional settings I should be checking/selecting which are not shown in the document? For instance, should I be ticking the 'Delete Rules at Package level' for both 'Already installed' and 'is installable' options?\r<br />\n<br />\nDo I need to add any additional files in the 'Additional Files' section, should I leave the xml file listed here\r<br />\n<br />\nDo I change the 'Update File' from CustomUpdateEngine to the MSI I want to install.\r<br />\n<br />\nOthers?\r<br />\n<br />\nApologies for the lengthy question, but hopefully solving this will allow me to publish a lot of other packages.\r<br />\n<br />\nOne last thing.  Is it possible to modify a custom update at the point where you add the components such as 'Allow to execute file', 'Allow to uninstall...' etc.  At the moment I am deleting and re-creating the complete package.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks for any help.\r<br />\n<br />\nPete.<br />\n",
