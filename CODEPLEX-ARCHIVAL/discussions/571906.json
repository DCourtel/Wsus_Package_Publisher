On smaller resolutions for example the update creation wizzards window is often too high to fit on the screen, so i can't reach the buttons on the buttom of the window. If I manually decrease the height of the window, its contents will be messed up in some strange kind of behaviour.\r<br />\nMaybe it would be a nice solution also to &quot;outsource&quot; some of the generally not so often used buttons and fields of the wizzard to an extra window reachable through an &quot;Extended options&quot; button  or something like that, to decrease the needed space on the dialog box.<br />\n",
