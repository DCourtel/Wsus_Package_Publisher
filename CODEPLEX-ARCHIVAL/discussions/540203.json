Does anyone have an idea, how to solve this Problem?\r<br />\n<br />\nHere some more details:\r<br />\nWe created and approved an Update called &quot;Adobe Reader XI MUI&quot;.\r<br />\nAfter some time we found out, that this Version of Adobe Reader causes Problems in another application. \r<br />\nSo we decided to create an new Update called &quot;Adobe Reader 11&quot;. Just the German Version.\r<br />\nUnfortunately we have just deleted the old &quot;Adobe Reader XI MUI&quot; from the WPP Console and have forgotten to define the new &quot;Adobe Reader 11&quot; as superwise.\r<br />\nThe Installation of the new one is no Problem, but the old one still appears and Fails.\r<br />\n<br />\nHope you understand my English and have any idea.\r<br />\nThanks a lot.\r<br />\nIsarf<br />\n",
