I have just come onboard and looked at the other WSUS sites by adding the replica servers into the software. I can now see that updates that were created&gt;approved&gt;not approved&gt;deleted on the main wsus site are appearing on the replica sites. These are therefore going out to the clients still. \r<br />\nI cannot unapprove this software remoting from the main wsus server to the replica site or uninstalling the wsus packager on the replica site as the box is greyed out. \r<br />\nIs there a way of stopping the deleted updates that are on the main server, going out from the replica sites?\r<br />\nMany Thanks\r<br />\nDarren<br />\n",
