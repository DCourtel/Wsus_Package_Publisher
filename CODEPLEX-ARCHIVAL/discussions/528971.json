    "Html": "Hello,<br />\n<br />\nI'm trying to redefine rules for Flash Plugin deployments - as of today I use the predefined 'installable' rule &amp; add a 'WindowsVersion' rule to define the 'ProductType'. This works without a hassle but: the update shows as needed even on machines where e.g. Firefox is not installed.<br />\n<br />\nNow I've tried to to add a 'FileExists' rule with the only parameter &quot;C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Mozilla Firefox\\firefox.exe&quot; - pressing 'Publish' crashes WPP. This happens , too, if I revise an existing Package &amp; try to modify the rule ...<br />\n<br />\nCan't see my error, any help appreciated ;)<br />\n<br />\nRegards<br />\nJoerg<br />\n",
