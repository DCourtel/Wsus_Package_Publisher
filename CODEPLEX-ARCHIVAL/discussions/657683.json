    "Html": "Hi, I am connected to a wsus 6.3.9600 server. All OK until I configured the wsus server to use SSL. When I now try to publish I receive a createDirectory failed error. WPP is installed on the WSUS server, and is configured as below:\r<br />\n<br />\n```\r\n&lt;WsusPackagePublisher&gt;\r<br />\n  &lt;Server&gt;<br />\n<pre><code>&lt;Name&gt;wsus.company.i&lt;/Name&gt;\n&lt;IsLocal&gt;True&lt;/IsLocal&gt;\n&lt;Port&gt;8531&lt;/Port&gt;\n&lt;UseSSL&gt;True&lt;/UseSSL&gt;\n&lt;IgnoreCertErrors&gt;False&lt;/IgnoreCertErrors&gt;\n&lt;DeadLineDaysSpan&gt;0&lt;/DeadLineDaysSpan&gt;\n&lt;DeadLineHour&gt;0&lt;/DeadLineHour&gt;\n&lt;DeadLineMinute&gt;0&lt;/DeadLineMinute&gt;\n&lt;VisibleInWsusConsole&gt;Never&lt;/VisibleInWsusConsole&gt;</code></pre>\n\n&lt;/Server&gt;\r<br />\n&lt;/WsusPackagePublisher&gt;\r<br />\n<br />\nI have checked the share and ntfs permissions on \\server\\UpdateServicesPackages and \\server\\wsuscontent and all ok (no problem when wsus is not configured for ssl). The wsus server is using a company generated certificate for it's client ssl connection, and WPP is using a WPP self-signed certificate for the software packages. Both certificates are published in the correct stores.\r<br />\n<br />\nIf I revert the wsus server to non ssl, then all works ok, but non-ssl is not permitted in my organization. Any help greatly appreciated.\r<br />\n<br />\nMany thanks```<br />\n",
