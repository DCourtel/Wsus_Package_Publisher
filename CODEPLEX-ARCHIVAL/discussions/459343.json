(HP update tool, manual installation...)<br />\n<blockquote>\nThe question is how this is possible when the &quot;Installed&quot;rules for this HP package is blank?<br />\n</blockquote>\nIn fact, a package have tow level of rules, &quot;Installable Item&quot; Level and &quot;Package&quot; Level. WPP only show you &quot;Installable Item&quot; Level rules.\r<br />\nIn Catalogs, rules are often in &quot;Package&quot; Level.\r<br />\n<br />\nBut the most important question is, what screen capture tool are you using ? It look like so cool :-)<br />\n",
