I actually tried to export the update, and edit the XML slightly, but I couldn't figure out how to re-package the .cab file with the new .XML file.\r<br />\n<br />\nIs there any way to make small changes in custom updates now?\r<br />\nIf not, is it possible that you could add a way to do this in WPP 2.0?\r<br />\nIt could be a .XML import feature or it could be a Custom update template.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks,\r<br />\nNikolaj Pedersen.<br />\n",
