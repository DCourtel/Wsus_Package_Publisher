    "Html": "Hello / Bonjour,\r<br />\n<br />\nRecently i test the WPP for publishing  64 bitsApps with success :  now i wonder about what is the best way to publish packages for 32 and 64 bits computers in the same wsus group of computers ( with W7 pro 32/64 bits and W7 Embedded 32 bits)\r<br />\n<br />\nIf i want to publish a IE 11 package to upgrade the computers with IE10 i need to prepare scripts or package for 32 and 64 bits versions OS.\r<br />\n<br />\nShould i publish 2 packages  (32 and 64 bits), and let the computer choose the right version for them ? Is that ok ? \r<br />\nor in WPP must i configure it in different way and how ?\r<br />\nor simply make different computers groups to distinguish 32 and 64 bits versions ?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks in advance for your response !<br />\n",
