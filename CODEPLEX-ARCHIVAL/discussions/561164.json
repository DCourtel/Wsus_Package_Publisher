I have tried the &quot;OR&quot; Feature but it gets deleted after publishing and then both querys are valid and this is why the package is not available on any client (32-bit and 64-bit).\r<br />\n<br />\nThe goal ist to install a update when any version of this software is installed. If there is nothing installed the update should not be installed.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks!<br />\n",
