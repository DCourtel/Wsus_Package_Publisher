In the Last report status time column we can see that servers report back at about the same time.\r<br />\nFrom what I can see some patches applied does not show up at all, am I missing something obvious here?\r<br />\n<br />\nThe report tab is empty, if we could have some values in these columns our patch management would be a lot easier.\r<br />\nBeeing able to see if a machine is pending reboot before pushing patches and beeing able to see if an update failed would be perfect.\r<br />\n<br />\nIn our environmen we have eight different computer Groups and three different WSUS policys.\r<br />\nGetting the proper info under these tabs would be most helpful.\r<br />\nDoes anyone have clue why the info is not there?\r<br />\nAt the moment we are allowing all network traffic between server LAN and the WSUS-server ip address.\r<br />\n<br />\nWe found this application about a year ago and we have not really used its potential, but that is going to change. It is a great application!\r<br />\n<br />\nThank you, \r<br />\n<br />\nPeter Ã…kerblom\r<br />\nStockholm<br />\n",

At the beginning I was thinking that the date refers to the installation date. But in fact it is the date of publication of the package. I think this tab will disappear in WPP v2.<br />\n<blockquote>\nThe report tab is empty...<br />\n</blockquote>\nEnsure, you have selected at least one computer. At least, one update is approved in the ComputerGroup where the selected computer is.<br />\n",
