Created updatepackages, published them and everything is fine. But if I make a reboot of the WSUS-Server and start the WPP again, I get the message that no certificate is availible. I can import the cetificate again, restart the the WSUSservice and... everything is &quot;green&quot;. Ok, it works but it's not best practice :).<br />\nThe WSUS is up to date (Build 3.2.7600.274) and WPP is running on the WSUS. Some ideas?<br />\n<br />\nEdit: The WSUS is running on Windows Server 2008R2 (DC) on Port 8530 (THX Winfried for hint).<br />\n",
