    "Html": "Hi all,\r<br />\n<br />\nI have installed WPP on my Windows Server 2012 R2 server. There is also my WSUS installed.\r<br />\n<br />\nI can't create any package with WPP as I always get the error message &quot;CreateDirectory failed&quot;.\r<br />\nI made a standard installation, didn't changed a path. I first thought, that it is a problem with the access rights for the path. But I already checked this. I can manually create folders. \r<br />\nHas anybody an idea how to fix it or where it comes from? Do I have to check some registry paths? All ideas are welcome as I really couldn't find a solution so far in the internet.\r<br />\n<br />\nOr: If there is no easy solution: Is there a proper way to uninstall wpp, so that I can start from the beginning?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks a lot<br />\n",
