But doesn't really work &quot;plug&amp;play&quot;.\r<br />\n<br />\nWhen a deploy directly the update, it fail with this MSI log : <br />\n<blockquote>\nMSI (s) (3C:30) [14:52:55:575]: Product: Adobe Flash Player 21 ActiveX -- Installation failed.<br />\n<br />\nMSI (s) (3C:30) [14:52:55:575]: Windows Installer installed the product.

Consult the Windows Installer SDK for detailed command line help.<br />\n/QN<br />\n</blockquote>\nIt's because WSUS publisher implicitly always add /qn options.\r<br />\nAnd by default, the Adobe repository add Command Line : /qn REBOOT=ReallySuppress\r<br />\nThe msiexec has this options passed and fail : /qn /qn REBOOT=ReallySuppress\r<br />\n<br />\nOnly revise the update and remove &quot;/qn&quot; from Command Line\r<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"http://img15.hostingpics.net/pics/977776wsuspublisherflashremoveqn.png\" alt=\"Image\" />\r<br />\n<br />\nPS : it's very confusing to see /q in example /q, /s, /silent if it always implicit to wsus publisher... I think we need to remove this from text.<br />\n",
