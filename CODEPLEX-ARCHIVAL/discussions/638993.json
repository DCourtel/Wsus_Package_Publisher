I want to notify by email when new catalogs are available, it seems there is no functionnality in WPP to notify. So I want to check with a script the .cab files saved locally.  \n<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Does the check work when WPP is running (if we always keep it open) ? If yes, is it a define time when the check will run ?</li>\n<li>Does the check work when we run WPP ?</li>\n<li>Which element is checked ? (Is it the CreationDate attribut in the XML or the PackageID ,... ?)</li>\n<li>When an update is detected, does WPP automatically download the new file and save it into the &quot;Subscribed Catalogs&quot; folder ? </li>\n<li>\nIs it possible to run WPP like a service ?<br />\n</li>\n</ol>\nThanks<br />\n",
