Look at this page for telling MSI to log : <a href=\"http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc759262(v=ws.10).aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">MSI CommandLine</a><br />\n<br />\nTry to run the MSI or the EXE manually on the computers to see if it install. <br />\nPersonnaly, I always use EXE for publishing Java. Because EXE file do many check before installing Java, to ensure that Java can be installed safely. And even if Internet Explorer run at the time of the installation, Java will install properly.<br />\n<blockquote>\nAlso I can't appear to delete products, the software crashes, from the logs I see this <br />\n</blockquote>\nI have received many Support Data File where user try to delete 'Non Empty Product'. This is not allow. In fact there is a bug in the UI of WPP, so that user can try to delete 'Non Empty Products'.<br />\nTry deleting ALL UPDATES in the product, then delete the product. Sorry for the inconvenience. This bug will be fix in the next release.<br />\nSee <a href=\"https://wsuspackagepublisher.codeplex.com/workitem/52\" rel=\"nofollow\">This post for more explaination</a>.<br />\n",
