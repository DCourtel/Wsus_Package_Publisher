The plan is to use it to publish the PatchMyPC SCUP catalog to our fresh WSUS server so that we can have a central point to publish Microsoft and third-party updates. \r<br />\nBefore buying the full catalog, I wanted to try it so I downloaded their demo catalog but whatever software I try to publish return me a &quot;Not Applicable&quot; status for my test group. \r<br />\n<br />\nWhere should I look at to try and troubleshoot this issue ? Updates are being pulled from WSUS by my client computers but it looks like I have a configuration error somewhere with WPP so any help would be welcome.<br />\n",

    "Html": "Here's a little addition : all the &quot;Status Not Applicable&quot; issues come with the PatchMyPC demo catalog. There might be something wrong or that does not work with my architecture in their catalog because I successfully published Nmap with a custom update to the same test group.\r<br />\n<br />\nIf one of you has some insights about why there are some publication problems with the PatchMyPC demo catalog, I would be more than happy to hear them. Not that my WSUS service is running on a Windows 2016 server. :)<br />\n",
