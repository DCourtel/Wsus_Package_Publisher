However I'm struggling to understand how those machines are happily downloading Windows Updates from the WSUS server (which is defined by GPO with FQDN), but failing to download the updates defined in WPP e.g. Adobe through SCUP and signed with certificate on all machines concerned. The WPP error itself suggests the inability to download the update.\r<br />\n<br />\nOur environment is 10,000+ machines and all predominately works well with the exception of ~200 machines that cannot resolve the WSUS / WPP (same server) by hostname only, but can using FQDN.\r<br />\n<br />\nThis is what lead me to believe that the URL defined in WPP needed to be fully qualified.
