How can I delete some of this (empty) folders if not needed anymore? <br />\nFor example: After releasing &quot;Adobe Reader XI&quot; i don't need the folder &quot;Adobe Reader X&quot; anymore. Also a few misstyped folders I want to delete (that did not affect anything, but the design... :) ).<br />\n<br />\nIs there a way &quot;out of the box&quot;, or have i to do this in SUSDB?<br />\n<br />\nThanks in advance<br />\n<br />\nKurt<br />\n",

Check the checkbox : Connect to the local server.</li>\n<li>\nIn the &quot;When Publishing a new Update&quot; option, you need to choose one of these two options : &quot;Let me choose&quot; or &quot;Always...&quot;<br />\n</li>\n<li>\nEnsure there is no updates in this folder. If there is some, decline it, then delete it.
