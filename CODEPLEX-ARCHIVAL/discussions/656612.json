For what I've seen so far I really like the product. \r<br />\nI'm currently testing some updates deployments and notice that some update will deploy as new applications (Java, Flash player). My problem with that is if I approve the package, it will be distribute to all the PC/Server in the container. \r<br />\n<br />\nIs there a way to only distribute if a previous version of the product exist?\r<br />\n<br />\nThank you<br />\n",
