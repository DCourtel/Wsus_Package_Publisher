    "Html": "Hello,\r<br />\n<br />\nthere are many different installations of Adobe Reader in our enterprise. Most of them are 11.0.03 but even MUI versions and many 11.0.04 and 11.0.05.\r<br />\nFurther several of them are allready published by WPP but without customized settings.\r<br />\n<br />\nNow i want to republish Adobe Reader and prefer some customized settings and the latest version 11.0.06.\r<br />\n<br />\nMy previous method is downloading the latest version 11.0.06 from\r<br />\nftp://ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/reader/win/11.x/11.0.06/de_DE/\r<br />\nunzip it und open the included AcroRead.msi with the Adobe Customization Wizard XI.\r<br />\n<br />\nEdited points:<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Installation Path to &quot;C:\\Program Files\\Adobe\\Adobe Reader 11.0&quot; (ignoring x86 and x64 because of a simple ruleset later in WPP)</li>\n<li>removed AutoUpdater</li>\n<li>\ndeactivated all possible online services\r<br />\netc.\r<br />\nAfter saving the the file i open in WPP the MSI Reader to check the MSI Product Code of my edited AcroRead.msi.\r<br />\nIt is still {AC76BA86-7AD7-1031-7B44-AB0000000001} whether if i open the default AcroRead.msi of version 11.0.00 or later.\r<br />\nIt is obviously always the msi file of version 11.0.00 independent of the version of the exe file.<br />\n</li>\n</ul>\nNevertheless i create in WPP a new Update and select the setup.exe and additional Setup.ini, ABCPY.ini, AcroRead.msi, AcroRead.mst and Data1.cab.\r<br />\nMy allready installed ruleset is<br />\n<pre><code>&lt;lar:And&gt;\n&lt;msiar:MsiProductInstalled ProductCode=&quot;{ac76ba86-7ad7-1031-7b44-ab0000000001}&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;bar:WindowsVersion Comparison=&quot;GreaterThan&quot; MajorVersion=&quot;5&quot; MinorVersion=&quot;1&quot; ProductType=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;bar:FileExists Path=&quot;C:\\Program Files\\Adobe\\Adobe Reader 11.0\\Reader\\AcroRd32.exe&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;/lar:And&gt;</code></pre>\n\nMy still installable ruleset is<br />\n<pre><code>&lt;lar:Or&gt;\n&lt;lar:And&gt;\n&lt;bar:WindowsVersion Comparison=&quot;GreaterThan&quot; MajorVersion=&quot;5&quot; MinorVersion=&quot;1&quot; ProductType=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;lar:Not&gt;&lt;msiar:MsiProductInstalled ProductCode=&quot;{ac76ba86-7ad7-1031-7b44-ab0000000001}&quot;/&gt;&lt;/lar:Not&gt;\n&lt;/lar:And&gt;\n&lt;lar:And&gt;\n&lt;bar:WindowsVersion Comparison=&quot;GreaterThan&quot; MajorVersion=&quot;5&quot; MinorVersion=&quot;1&quot; ProductType=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;msiar:MsiProductInstalled ProductCode=&quot;{ac76ba86-7ad7-1031-7b44-ab0000000001}&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;lar:Not&gt;&lt;bar:FileExists Path=&quot;C:\\Program Files\\Adobe\\Adobe Reader 11.0\\Reader\\AcroRd32.exe&quot;/&gt;&lt;/lar:Not&gt;\n&lt;/lar:And&gt;\n&lt;/lar:Or&gt;</code></pre>\n\nAfter approving my test clients get this new windows update. But by installing it the installer detects an already existing Adobe Reader installation and requires a user input to repair or uninstall it. If i check the uninstall procedure the uninstallation works fine but the reinstallation of the new customized package has to be initiated by Windows Update again.\r<br />\n<br />\nMy matter is that i do not want the users to be required to uninstall a previous Adobe Reader version. I would prefer if the previous installed version uninstalls und the new installs absolutely silently.\r<br />\nIn the Customization Tool ist the option &quot;Remove all versions of Reader&quot; already checked.\r<br />\n<br />\nAny ideas?<br />\n",

    "Html": "Hi,<br />\n<br />\nI have had the same problem with almost exact the same symptoms. I found out why there is only the Adobe 11.0.0 version installed:<br />\nWhen you extract the archive with 7Zip, only 5 files are extracted. Looking inside the MSI package there is alway version 11.0. I wondered why the version is 11.0 when installing from MSI or from extracted setup.exe, and the version is 11.0.06 when installing from downloaded and packaged AdbeRdr11006_en_EN.exe.<br />\n<br />\nAs stated here<br />\n<a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/dmcmahon/2010/06/16/how-to-extract-an-msi-file-from-the-exe-for-adobe-reader/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blogs.adobe.com/dmcmahon/2010/06/16/how-to-extract-an-msi-file-from-the-exe-for-adobe-reader/</a><br />\nyou can extract the exe with an option<br />\n<pre><code>AdbeRdr11006_en_US.exe&quot; -nos_ne</code></pre>\n\n<strong>This will extract also a 11.0.06 MSP file.</strong> <br />\n<br />\nProblem: you want to update, so you must use the 11.0.06 MSP file.
