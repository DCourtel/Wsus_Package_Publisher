Server A (Network A, Domain A) and Server B (Network B, Domain B)<br />\n<br />\nIn the past I've managed to import the self-signed WPP/WSUS certificate created on Server A into Server B, and use it as a signing certificate, which allowed me to easily import new packages from Server A to Server B to avoid creating each package twice on each server.<br />\n<br />\nRecently I had to reinstall Server B from scratch and I don't remember how I imported the self-signed certificate created on Server A to Server B in the past. I tried using a .CER to .PFX converter found here (<a href=\"https://certopfx.codeplex.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://certopfx.codeplex.com/</a>), but that doesn't seem to work.<br />\n<br />\nAs I said above, I was able to accomplish this somehow before, on the old Server B, but I just don't remember how I did it or for some reason it does not work this time around.<br />\n<br />\nAny input would be appreciated.<br />\n",
