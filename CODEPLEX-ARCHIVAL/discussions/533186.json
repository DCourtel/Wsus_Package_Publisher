    "Html": "Hi mnikolaev,\r<br />\n<br />\nFirst, a custom update can return only one 'Return Code', so you don't have to declare two variables.\r<br />\n<br />\nIn the update Wizard, the return code section allow you to define the meaning of the return code. For example, let's say your powershell script return -1 if success, 255 if success but a reboot is required and 254 if failed. Then you can create these return codes here.<br />\n",
