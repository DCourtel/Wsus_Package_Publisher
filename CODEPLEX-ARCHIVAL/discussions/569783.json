    "Html": "I'm currently having two issues with my Adobe Reader packages. The first one being I have a test machine running Adobe Reader 11.0.0.8 currently and created the package for Adobe Reader 11.0.0.9. WPP is says the newer update is installed already under status when I check the machine it is still running 11.0.0.8.\r<br />\n<br />\nWe recently tested changes with Group Policy to hide updates for Java and Adobe Reader to avoid having multiple people calling the Help Desk when the program tells them they need to update. I'm not sure if this could be related but figured it worth mentioning.\r<br />\n<br />\nThe other issue I'm having is on a few machines, the Reader update would install, but no shortcuts would be visible. Not even from the Start Menu and All Programs. The only way to open reader (without opening a .pdf) is navigating to the home directory (C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Adobe\\Reader 11.0\\Reader). Any ideas on why this issue would happen in a fashion that appears to be random among test users.<br />\n",

So, the update installs with &quot;System&quot; account and therefore doesn't have access to the user's profile.\r<br />\nIf you use the option &quot;Can request user input&quot;, you will probably have these (useless) shortcuts, but you will also have a user interface shown during the install.<br />\n",
