When I create the update in WPP, in rules I add a new rule - windows version - less than 8. I publish the update and IT STILL APPEARS in clients with Windows 8. What am i doing wrong? Should I active &quot;reverse rule&quot; or &quot;delete rule from package level&quot; in one case?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks in advanced<br />\n",
