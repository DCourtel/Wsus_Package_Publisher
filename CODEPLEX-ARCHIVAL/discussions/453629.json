I created successfully a package. I approved it to a computer group. The windows update services from a server found the package &quot;adobe reader xi&quot; and installed it without problems. A few seconds later the windows update show me the same package for installation again.\r<br />\n<br />\nI take a look in system control -&gt; programs and functions and i see the adobe reader xi entry.\r<br />\nCan someone explain what am I doing wrong?<br />\n",
