Anything I should know?  I'm just worried that I'm going to try to upgrade this installation and suddenly lose any packaged updates I already have, or who knows what else.\r<br />\n<br />\nLike I said, it's something I think should be pretty straightforward, but I'd like some confirmation on my base assumptions (running the standard installation won't overwrite my existing configuration, etc.) before I charge on ahead.\r<br />\n<br />\nAny help is greatly appreciated.  Thanks!\r<br />\n<br />\n--LC<br />\n",
