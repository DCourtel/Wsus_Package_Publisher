I go to create a Package and when I click on Publish I get &quot;CreateDirectory failed&quot; I am not sure what is going on. I have looked up online and do not see anything related to this issue except permissions to the temp folder which I have. It was working last week, but believe maybe some folders were deleted. WSUS is working fine. Any help would be appreciated. <br />\n<br />\nWPP Release: 1.3.1411.9<br />\n",
