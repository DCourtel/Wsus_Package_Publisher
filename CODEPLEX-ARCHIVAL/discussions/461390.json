    "Html": "Hello,\r<br />\n<br />\nit seems to me that it is only possible to approve updates for uninstallation when the update is MSI based. EXE based updates don't give me this option. I think this is because MSI update parameters are added automatically by the wsus logic and the API doesn't offer options for this case - right?\r<br />\n<br />\nDo you see any way to import EXE updates with option to uninstallation? maybe with different command lines for install / uninstall? Or is the only way to import the update twice with different command lines?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks in advance for you answer.\r<br />\n<br />\nGreets\r<br />\nMarco<br />\n",

Wsus agent only know how to uninstall MSI files.
