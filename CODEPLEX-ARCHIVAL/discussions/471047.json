I walked through the documented guideline and succeeded with &quot;the update has been published&quot; - so certificate configuration should be fine.\r<br />\n<br />\nThe update was showing up at tree &quot;updates&quot; with Count (0). When I click on it, nothing happens. main window stay empty. After restart WPP, no update is shown below updates.\r<br />\n<br />\nThe same happens when I try to add HP catalog. I can browse and download content, after adding It shows up with (0) but can't go further, after restart, the entry is gone.\r<br />\n<br />\nInstallation is at %program files%, rebooted twice the Server. \r<br />\n<br />\nOn clients the last installed items are shown like this:\r<br />\n-&gt; Adobe Reader XI\r<br />\n-&gt; Adobe Reader XI - Deutsch\r<br />\n-&gt; Intel(R) AMT LMS_SOL for AMT 9.xx [9.0.3.1347.A1]\r<br />\n-&gt; Adobe Reader XI - Deutsch\r<br />\n<br />\nthats obviously my testing, but i never approved any update.\r<br />\n<br />\nSo, what could be wrong?<br />\n",
