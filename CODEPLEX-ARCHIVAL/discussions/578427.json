    "Html": "First off, are you doing an update or a deployment? For updates, I highly recommend using the msp files instead of the executables, and you can even use the SCUP catalog provided by Adobe and import them into WSUS using WPP. Here's the link to the Adobe documentation: <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/devnet-docs/acrobatetk/tools/AdminGuide/sccm.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.adobe.com/devnet-docs/acrobatetk/tools/AdminGuide/sccm.html</a><br />\n<br />\nTwo places to look for clues: <code>%windir%\\temp\\customupdateengine.log</code> and if you enable logging in the Adobe Reader patch, then wherever you put the log files for that. (MSI switch <code>/l*v %windir%\\temp\\patchname.log</code> is what I'd use, if you're doing an MSI install, which is what you should be doing).<br />\n<br />\nYou can get the MSI for 11.0 for your preferred language or MUI here: <a href=\"ftp://ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/reader/win/11.x/11.0.00/\" rel=\"nofollow\">ftp://ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/reader/win/11.x/11.0.00/</a>, and the MSP for the latest patch here: <a href=\"ftp://ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/reader/win/11.x/11.0.10/misc/\" rel=\"nofollow\">ftp://ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/reader/win/11.x/11.0.10/misc/</a><br />\n<br />\nIf you're doing a deployment, you can include the MSI and MSP in the patch, and tell the MSI to install the patch along with the product. You can use an MST file to make any customizations to the MSI prior to install. Since WPP starts the MSI install command line with <code>msiexec /i [msi file] /qn /norestart</code>, you just need to add <code>/p [filename].msp</code> to the command line to install the patch along with the product.<br />\n<br />\nOh, and if the MSP doesn't get installed because it requires an absolute path—it happens sometimes, hopefully this isn't the case here, though—instead of a relative one, you can use <code>%windir%\\SoftwareDistribution\\Download\\Install\\[filename].msp</code>, since that's where the WUA unpacks the cab files created by WPP/WSUS for installation.<br />\n",
