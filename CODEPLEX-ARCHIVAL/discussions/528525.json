I fumbled through it, but when I click &quot;Publish&quot;, I get the following message:<br />\n\r<br />\n&quot;<strong>Could not load type 'XPathOperatorGroup' from assembly 'System.Data.SqlXml, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublickKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089' due to value type mismatch.</strong>&quot;\r<br />\n<br />\nI looked for something related online, but didn't find anything.  Can you help me, please?  It's probably something very simple that I'm doing wrong.\r<br />\n<br />\nOne other question.  If you specify the jre1.7.0_51.msi as the <em>update file</em>, I'm not clear what goes in the <em>additional files</em> field.<br />\n",

If the main file didn't require any other file, you don't have to put anything here. It is essentially used by custom updates, when the custom update refer to other files (for example, the custom update need to run a vbscript...). it is also used when the main file need a config file or anything else.<br />\n",
