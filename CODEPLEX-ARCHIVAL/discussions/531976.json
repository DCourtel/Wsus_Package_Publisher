What happens when the next Flash update comes along?  Do I decline/delete my entry for 12.0.0.44 and add the next one?  If not, I can see how things will get very cluttered in a short matter of time.\r<br />\n<br />\nAlso, I have seen some odd behavior from the Adobe Flash 12.0.0.44 catalog.  I got it from Adobe via the subscription.  When I approved it, I started seeing a number of failures listed in WSUS.  However, upon closer inspection, the update has succeeded.  If I run a report on the update and look at page 2, most of the computers show that it failed.  However, if you click on &quot;Failed&quot; for a given computer, you get a message that it succeeded.  This is true for most entries.  Checking Programs and Features confirms this.  Perhaps there was a problem with the catalog provided by Adobe.  Has anyone else seen this?<br />\n",
