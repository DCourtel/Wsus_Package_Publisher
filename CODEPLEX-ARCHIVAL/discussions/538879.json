So as much new version I install, more Mozilla Firefox I have in Programs. What am I dpoing wrong? The way I do the package is: <br />\n<ul>\n<li>I create the msi with AdvancedInstaller. Fot that I copy all the content of the folder Mozilla Firefox of that version from another computer with that version already installed. \r<br />\nThanks!</li>\n</ul>\n",
