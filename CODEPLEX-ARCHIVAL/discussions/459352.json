    "Html": "First off, great project and thanks for the hard work in adding features and addressing problems.  Here's the scenario:<br />\n<br />\nWe have our main server 2k8 R2 WSUS server that downloads MS patches and stores them locally.  We can publish MS and third party patches to our Win 7 clients with no problems from that server.  We proceeded to set up a replica 2k8 R2 server and it does synchronize and show both MS and the third party patches published from the upstream server, however, all third party patches show the path in the Folder field red and the string in the Id field orange.  WSUS clients directed to that server are unable to detect the third party update packages but if pointed to the upstream server they have no problem detecting/installing them.  We noticed that this is caused because the cab files are not being replicated, if we copy the cab files manually from the upstream server then the field clears the red status but once a WSUS synchronization is performed the files are deleted.  MS patching works fine from the replica server.  Both servers and clients are using the same 2048 bit self signed certificate that was generated on the main upstream server.  Any input on what the problem may be?<br />\n",

I will post back with any further issues.  Interesting thing is that the Id field still shows up orange...<br />\n",

Replica servers doesn't fill the &quot;UpdateServicesPackages&quot; folder. Only Upstream servers does it. This is why the field is in Orange and not Red. The situation can be normal.<br />\n",

I have a couple questions regarding your problem; is it the Folder field that is showing up red on the replica server?  If you browse to the path in the WSUS content store does the .cab file exist there?  Is this a new replica server where this is occurring or all replica servers?\r<br />\n<br />\nWhen I encountered this it definitely did end up being a certificate issue.  I would check the Windows Event Viewer Application log and filter the view by Windows Server Update Services source on the replica server after performing a synchronization to see if you are getting any errors as a start.<br />\nPlease let me know what you find.  Also, reference my last post above to be sure server port and certificate is in right location if it is a new replica server.  <br />\n",
