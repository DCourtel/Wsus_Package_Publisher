    "Html": "Hi guys,<br />\n<br />\nI have 2 issues with publishing the Uninstall update of &quot;Java Auto Update&quot; with the WPP. I have followed the guide on the website but still I have some issues with removing the Java Auto Updater. <br />\n<ol>\n<li>\nWhen the client wants to uninstall the Java Auto update after the installation of Java, Windows Update shows then a pop-up which says: Do you want to uninstall this package &quot;YES&quot; or &quot;NO&quot;? I thought that uninstalling will happen silently on the background and Windows Update should not show a pop-up about this. How can I make sure that this will not happen? Btw, this is a Windows 7 machine.<br />\n</li>\n<li>\nOn Windows 8.1, it takes very long before the Java update 8 u 25 is finished with installing. Also Java auto updater is not removed. Did I do something wrong?<br />\n</li>\n</ol>\n",

Please let me clearify a couple of things for you. First of all:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>\nI have followed the documentation on the website (Installing Java 7u21 without Java Auto Updater). At step 5, I need to create a Executable Element in a customized update. This will be used to uninstall Java Auto Updater after the installation of Java 8u25. <br />\n</li>\n<li>\nThe command that I have used is just like the command in the document which is: /qn /norestart with msiexec.exe<br />\n</li>\n<li>\nIn Windows 7, after the installation of Java I receive a pop-up which says: Do you want to uninstall this package &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot;. This <strong>ONLY</strong> happens in Windows 7.<br />\n</li>\n<li>\nIn Windows 8, it takes very long before Java 8u25 is installed. I don't receive any pop-up about uninstalling Java Auto Updater but it also not removed. <br />\n</li>\n</ol>\n<strong>DCourtel:</strong><br />\n<blockquote>\nEnsure you have not tick the option &quot;Can request user inputs&quot;.<br />\nWhy are you talking of installing Java 8u25, your package is to uninstall Java Auto Updater, which is another product ?<br />\nIn this case, for Windows 8, he needs to ensure that Microsoft .Net 3.5 is installed.

    "Html": "Ah, yeah. I'm actually having issues with the Java 8 installer myself. The instructions are still good for JRE 7, but Oracle changed the installer in version 8. I gave up on using the EXE file anymore, and I'm trying to get the MSI file that the EXE extracts to %LOCALAPPDATA%\\LocalLow\\Sun\\Java\\jre1.8.0_31. Right now I'm getting a 1722 error when the install executes, but I may be on the brink of solving that one. I'll let you know how I do it once I get it working.<br />\n",
