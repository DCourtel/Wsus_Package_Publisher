The intention of the package is to validate by means of the following registry key if the SCCM agent is installed and functioning correctly, before attempting to install, however I'm running into problems with the installed / installable rules configuration:\r<br />\n<br />\nHKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\CCM - SMSSLP - servername.fqdn\r<br />\n<br />\nI am able to create / publish etc. the package without a problem, but the following scenarios are not providing the expected behaviour:\r<br />\n<br />\nSCCM Agent installed and registry key correct - no update required\r<br />\nSCCM Agent installed, but registry key incorrect - update\r<br />\nSCCM Agent not installed - update\r<br />\n<br />\nAny guidance on past experience or best approach would be appreciated.<br />\n",
