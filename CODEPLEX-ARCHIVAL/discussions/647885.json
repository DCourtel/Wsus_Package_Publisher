One WSUS is in my enviroment (for Testing and generating Packages) and the other WSUS -Servers are at customer-locations.\r<br />\n<br />\nI didn't understand why the import-function does check the Signing, I didn't see a reason for that. Importing an Package is really the same then generating a package from scratch and so it would be better, if the import-function would do a resign of the package.\r<br />\n<br />\nBest regards\r<br />\nIngo<br />\n",
