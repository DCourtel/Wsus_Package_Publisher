This was more of having to save from right clicking on each device and have the information available in a column.  This would be something optional and by default did not have to be selected.\r<br />\n<br />\nTo save on the WMI query time you could first check if the OnLine value is &quot;Yes&quot; run the wmi query, if the OnLine value is No don't attempt to run the query?\r<br />\n<br />\nThis application is powerful and a tremendous addition to WSUS!<br />\n",
