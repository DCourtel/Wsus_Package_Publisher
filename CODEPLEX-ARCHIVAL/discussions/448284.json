Currently, I start learning how to use and I found that there is a problem at Updates -&gt; Create a Custom Update -&gt; Custom Update Creator.  On the window, there is a panel where you drop an action.  As I add many actions, I can't access the lower actions because there is no scroll bars.  Could you fix this for me?\r<br />\n<br />\nI also downloaded the source code and it seems that it doesn't match to the current release. Is it possible if I can download the latest sources?\r<br />\n<br />\nThank you,<br />\n",
