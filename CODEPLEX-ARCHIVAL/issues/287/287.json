    "Description": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI configured some WSUS Servers using SSL only Connections. (Windows Server 2012R2, 2008R2 doesn't matter) On all of them I can not connect with WPP using the \"connect to local Server\"-Checkbox. I'm always getting \"Connection failed: The request failed with HTTP Status 403: Forbidden.\"\r\nIf I'm using servername and SSL port (8531) without the mentioned Checkbox all is working fine. But than it's not possible to set updates to be visible in the WSUS console.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have this issue as well and a solution to it?\r\n\r\nregards\r\nNorbert",
