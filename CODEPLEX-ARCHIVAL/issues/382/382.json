    "Description": "Our parent company recently changed our WSUS server to be a downstream replica of their server. Prior to this I was using WSUS Package Publisher without any issues. After they changed the WSUS configuration, I could no longer revise or create new updates. I've just changed our on site WSUS server back to synchronise directly with Microsoft rather than another update server. I can now revise and create new packages using WSUS Package Publisher. However, I have a problem installing them on the client machines. I've created a superseding update for a piece of software we use and have approved it for installation. When I search for new updates on a client PC, it finds the new update, downloads it, but fails to install. It comes up each time with the following error message: \r\n\r\nSome update files aren't signed correctly.\r\n\r\nError code: (0x800b0109)\r\n\r\nAny ideas how I fix this?\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\nMark\r\n",
