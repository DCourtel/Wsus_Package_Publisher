    "Description": "* New GUI, based on Office Ribbon look & feel.\r\n* Enhance Multi-threading to avoid hangs.\r\n* Show Microsoft official updates.\r\n* Add ability to drag&drop rule when creating/editing an update.\r\n* Add the ability to filter datagridview like Excel does.\r\n* Enable displaying/modification of rules at package level.\r\n* When importing updates from Catalogs, enable to filter on already imported updates.\r\n* Allow users to edit Vendor name and product name when importing from Catalog. Create a \"Substitution Dictonnary\" to automatically make these changes.\r\n* Redesign Rule Assistant. Separate IsInstalled and IsInstallable. Separate UpdateLevel Rules and PackageLevel Rules.\r\n* Allow to publish MetaData only updates from catalogs.\r\n* CustomUpdate Engine should be wrote in C++ to be a native EXE instead of relying on .Net Framework\r\n* When showing pending updates, allow to select some of these updates to perform a remote installation.\r\n* Modify the \"Show pending updates\" component to to align with UI-Culture chosen in WPP.\r\n\r\n__Suggestions are welcome !__",
