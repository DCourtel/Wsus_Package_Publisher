    "Description": "I's me again ;)\r\n\r\nI am just trying to publish a custom WPP update which blows away the Java Runtime Environment auto updater. For this reason I want to delete the auto updater file jusched.exe with this WPP update and delete the registry values in the Run registry key.\r\n\r\nNow I want to kill the jusched process first to make it possible to delete the file than. I tried the following action but it doesn't work. The task is not killed and could not be deleted than. Maybe I'm doing something wrong? I saw that the process runs in a user context (Administrator) and tried to enable \"Run the update in a user context\" in the WPP update but with no effect.\r\n\r\nThe target OS is Windows 7 32 Bit and .NET 3.5 is installed. Other Custom Updates were working fine so far.\r\n\r\n![Image](http://i57.tinypic.com/2v0nxhi.jpg)",
