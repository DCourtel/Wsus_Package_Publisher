    "Description": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI am using V1.3.1401.04. I created the Adobe Flash Player updates today and since Adobe provided the wrong download files I have to delete these updates and create new ones with the correct files.\r\nI set the updates in the WSUS console to \"Not approved\" again, waited a bit, reconnected Package Publisher and tried to delete them there. But I got an error message, see attachment.\r\nDoes anyone have a solution/idea for that problem?\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\ndocwaremf",
