    "Description": "The latest version do not read and enter or update the msi product #. I have gone back to version 1.3.1407.29 and when I create a new update the program will read the msi and enter default rules for if it is installed and can it be installed using MSI product installed and the product # from the msi file. When I create a superseding update it will take forward the rules and update with the new msi product #. The new version 1.3.1504.15 does not do either of these. When creating a new update both is installed and can be installed are blank and when creating a superseding update the old msi product # is still in the rules not the new number.",
