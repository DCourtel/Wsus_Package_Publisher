    "Description": "Hello,\r\ni have Problems with importing a Certificate for the use with WPP/WSUS. I have generated a Certificate with the same attributes then the self-signed Cert, but WPP will not import this PFX-File and gives only a failure Message \"Failed to load the certificate - Check the File\". Import of the same pfx-file directly in the Certification-store with MMC works without failures.",
