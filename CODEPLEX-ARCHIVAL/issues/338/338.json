      "Message": "Hi Sabine,\n                 I'm starting from a fresh WSUS install and added the latest WPP release v1.3.1603.29. I'm transitioning from LUP and while trying to parrot some rules I had on packages on that noticed the installed rule and the corresponding negation or reverse rule under installable rules were empty. Not knowing if I should need to add the rules read a doc which seemed to show it would automatically populate and than came across your post. Long story short, yes your not alone ;-)",
