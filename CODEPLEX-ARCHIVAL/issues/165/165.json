    "Description": "I do not know if this issue is a WPP thing, but I'm starting here.  I'm trying to publish an update that uses a 'RegValueExists' rule.  That isn't impressive.  What is significant is if the value is of type 'REG_MULTI_SZ', workstations fail with an error message when searching for new updates.  If the value type is REG_SZ, all is well.\r\n\r\n<bar:RegValueExists Key=\"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\" Subkey=\"Software\\HelpBox\\userInstalled\" Value=\"Google Chrome\" Type=\"REG_MULTI_SZ\"/>\r\n\r\nHas anyone seen this?\r\n\r\n",

That fails as well on my computer with your last uploaded file.\n\nThe XML file generated by WPP is well-formed and valid in regards of the XSD validation. The Wsus server accepts it. I must admit that the Windows Update Agent, on clients computers, is a black box for me. I can't see what happens when the client inspects rules.\n\nDespite the fact that I didn't find any articles on Microsoft web site, that explicitly state it, my conclusion is that 'RegValueExists' didn't support REG_MULTI_SZ. [This article](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb531094.aspx) talks about this rule.",
