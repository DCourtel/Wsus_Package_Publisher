      "Message": "I confirm that, if trying to import a package that have been signed by a Wsus with a different certificate than the importing server, will throw an error.\nI can have a look to make WPP to be able to re-sign the package. But I will need to code a module for searching for signature in the package, and for signing the package if need. That can take some time for me to get all documentations.\nNote: this can be usefull for Windows Server 2012R2. Because wsus 6.3 seem not able anymore to issue self-signed certificate.",
