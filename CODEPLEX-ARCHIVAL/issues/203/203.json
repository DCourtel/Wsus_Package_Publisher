      "Message": "Yes, but with some limitation due to the lake of support for Detectoids in the Wsus API.\n\n* For now, it is impossible to know if the publication of a detectoid has been successful or has failed (in fact the Wsus API always throw an exception even if the publication has succeeds !)\n* When a detectoid has been publish, you can't see it neither in WPP nor in the Wsus console.\n* You can't determine whether or not a detectoid has already been published.\n\nI have sent to Winfried and you a beta release of WPP with Detectoids support. Tell me what you think about it.",
