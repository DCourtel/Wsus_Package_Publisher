If you restart WPP at 23h55, no check will occurs. If you restart WPP at 00h05, a new check will occur as it is not the same day than the previous check.",

This is the reason for want to have a Update Button.\n\nIs our proxy the reason? I have set the correct settings for the proxy, i can download the catalog and check for updates in the catalogs.\n\n",
