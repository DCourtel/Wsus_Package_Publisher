Especially for the certificate whom need to be deployed on clients computers (if you are using Active Directory, that's easy)\n\n_Issue 1: Custom updates disappeared when we reopen the WSUS package publisher. But, still we can see this update in WSUS console._ \n\nAs Norbert  said, \"Just tick the checkbox \"show locally published updates that are also visible....\" on the update tab under Settings.\"\n\n_After approving this update to one of WSUS group. We tried to click install a updates on some servers. But no response ( That software is not getting installed.)._ \n\nA lot of things can prevent an update to install on the client. Look into C:\\Windows\\WindowsUpdate.log for more informations on what's happen.\nIn the last screen capture, I can see an error message 80246007, which mean : \"The update has not been downloaded.\"\n\n_Do we have any log file to see what are updates are created with this tool and installed on clients._\n\nTo see what updates are created by the tool, look into %Temp%\\wpp-GUID.log. This file is the log file of WPP. It's deleted each time WPP start.\nTo see what updates are installed on clients computers, look into C:\\Windows\\WindowsUpdate.log. It's the log file of Windows Update Agent.",
