    "Description": "I am able to publish updates with WPP, but when my co-worker (admin on server) is opening WPP to publish updates, he received \"The certificate is invalid. You will not be able to publish updates.\"\r\n\r\nWhat can be done to resolve this and allow multiple users to publish updates to WSUS?  \r\nWe've attempted the following:\r\n* Within WPP , imported the certificate from his logon with cert password.  It states \"Failed to load the Certificate. Check the file.\"  This is the same file I used to import the cert initially when installing WPP.\r\n* Ran the native cert import wizard (pfx file)",
