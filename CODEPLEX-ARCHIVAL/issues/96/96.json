The error message say that Wsus can not issue a Self-Signed certificate and suggest to import a already generate certificate. \nProviding a Home-Made Certificate may works (you need your own Private Root Authority).\nI don't know if this is because it's a preview edition or a change in the Microsoft policy regarding self-signed certificate.\nI hope it's because of the edition type. \nI don't test other features of WPP on Server 2012R2 prev.\nI hope to have some time to do it this week-end.\n\nFor instance, I recommend to use Server 2012 but not 2012R2 prev.\n\nP.S. : It's not best practices to install Wsus on Domain Controller.\n[Wsus Best Practices](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff646928(WS.10).aspx)",
