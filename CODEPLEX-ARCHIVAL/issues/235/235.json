    "Description": "Hi,\r\n> In our setup the \"Last installed\" tab does not reflect the actual status of our servers. \r\n\r\nThis tab doesn't works as I was expected at first. At the beginning I was thinking that the date refers to the installation date. But in fact it is the date of publication of the package. I think this tab will disappear in WPP v2.\r\n\r\n> The report tab is empty...\r\n\r\nEnsure, you have selected at least one computer. At least, one update is approved in the ComputerGroup where the selected computer is.\r\n\r\n",
