    "Description": "Attempting to publish a package and Wsus Package Publisher (latest version and prior revision both) is giving error: \"Failed to sign package; error was: 2147942432\"\r\n\r\nAlso noted that in the Information tab of a prior package the Folder field is highlighted in red as if the URL for the WSUS server can't be reached.  I was having an issue with another application that involved the IIS Manager yesterday, but to my best recollection, I didn't make changes to the WSUS portion.  Can someone shed some light on what error 2147942432 is?  Thanks!",
