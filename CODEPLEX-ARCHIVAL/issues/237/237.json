    "Description": "I'm wondering if it'd be possible to refresh a single view in WPP instead of reloading everything with the Connect/Reload button, so that it'd be quicker to see changes to tasks that are being worked on. (sometimes using both), and so that after a \"refresh\", you end up in the same view you were in before you pressed the \"refresh\" button, instead of at the top level like what happens now with the Connect/Reload button.",
