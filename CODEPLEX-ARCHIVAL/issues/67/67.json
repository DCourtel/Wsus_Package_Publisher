(this could happen sometime depending of the responsiveness of remote computers and network).\n\nDo this test :\n   - Select Online computers and Offline computers.\n   - Note the name of Online Computers and Offline computers.\n   - Check the option, 'Show only online computers'.\n   - Send a 'DetectNow' command.\n   - In the 'Send Command' Window, compare computers name with the list you have write down previously.\n\nNormally, no 'Offline' computer should appear in the 'Send Command' Window. If you do the same test without checking the option 'Show only online computers', the 'Send Command' Window will show all the previously selected computers (online + offline).",
