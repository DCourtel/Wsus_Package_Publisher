    "Description": "Hi Guys,\r\n\r\nI'm using WPP for some weeks and I am still really pleased aboud it's functionality, works great.\r\nExcept one thing:\r\n\r\nToday I tried to create an update for PSR (http://www.passwordsafe.de/en/home.html) wich works fine on my first view with their distributed msi file (http://www.passwordsafe.de/nc/support/download-center/download/password-safe-v7-alle-editionen-msi-2.html). I did not change anything.\r\n\r\nSo what now happends is thas my test systems (win7, win7, win vista) install it correctly but after a quick search prevously installed update is back in the to-be-installed list. I already checked out the Id and product ID (same code?) and tried to change the rules wether it might be installed or not. But nothing changes. Also I tried to use an older version of WPP without any further changes to my problem.\r\n\r\nIdeas? Suggestions?\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\nBent",

I'm questioning myself if there is a problem on my clients because it never shows this behavior till this update last week. So I think it must be located somewhare in the WPP process or whatever on our WSUS Server. Not?\r\n\r\n@DCourtel:\r\nPlease find the attachment\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nBent",

The local Windows Update will install the Update again and again.\n\nPls decline the update and delete it. After this create the update pls again. On the Client you have to run the instructions in commandline i posted.",
