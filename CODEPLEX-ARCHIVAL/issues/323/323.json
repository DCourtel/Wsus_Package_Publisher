    "Description": "I have tried to create an update for the acrobat Flash 20 active x msi installer and get CreateDirectory failed.\r\n\r\nThis is on Server 2012 r2 version 6.3 build 9600\r\nRunning Update Server version 6.3.9600.16384\r\n\r\n\r\nThe user that is logged in is a domin admin,  I added that user to the wsus admin group\r\n\r\nI thought it might be a cert issues so i clicked create new certificate and it warned me that the one on the server was vaild so I did not recreate.  I have deployed the certificate to all computers with GPO and in the GPO allow 3rd party installs was setup to work with our old update server which was server 2k3 using local update publish which does not work with server 2012.\r\n\r\nThanks for any help\r\nDaniel",
