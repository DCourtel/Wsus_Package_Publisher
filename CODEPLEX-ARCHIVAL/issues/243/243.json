    "Description": "Hello,\r\n   I have currently started having an issue with WPP.  I go to create a Package and when I click on Publish I get \"CreateDirectory failed\"  I have attached the information to this, but I am not sure what is going on.  I have looked up online and do not see anything related to this issue except permissions to the temp folder which I have.  It was working last week, but believe maybe some folders were deleted.  WSUS is working fine.  Any help would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nWPP Release: 1.3.1411.9\r\n",

If the issue occurs as soon as you push the Publish button, that's where I'd look first.",
