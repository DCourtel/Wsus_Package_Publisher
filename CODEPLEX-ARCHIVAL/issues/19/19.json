    "Description": "Hello,\r\n\r\ni want publish many 3rd Party Software through WSUSPackagePublisher into WSUS. But i only want to manage the 3rd Party Software in WSUS.MSC. For this i run after publishing in WUP a Query or a Trigger like this:\r\n\r\nUPDATE [SUSDB].[dbo].[tbUpdate] SET [IsLocallyPublished] = 0 WHERE [IsLocallyPublished] <> 0\r\n\r\nAfter running this Query, i can't see my published 3rd Party Software in WSUS Package Publisher. \r\n\r\nPls make a Checkbox or another option to switch between Updates where SET [IsLocallyPublished] = 0 and Where SET = 1.\r\n\r\nThanks and Regards\r\nWinfried Sonntag",

And it is possible to give other Admins only rights for read the status. \r\n\r\nBut in WUP i need to 'see' the published 3rd Party Tools for update the 3rd Party Tools like Flash Player, Reader or Java Runtime.\r\n\r\nSorry, but in Local Update Publisher it is possible to see the Updates. I think you don't must read all updates at start, only i expand a node from treeview. Have a look on the picture, i attach this posting.",
