    "Description": "I had a problem with the certificate and I created another certificate. Now the updates that were signed with the first certificate will not work, so I tried to re-sign these updates, but not working. These updates are still signed by the first certificate.\r\n\r\nHow I could re-sign all previous updates with the new generated certificate? Or should I create all the updates again?\r\n\r\nThanks!",

      "Message": "Hello!\n\nI have an old certificate with date 07/03/2013, valid until 06/03/2018. This certificate was used for sign all my updates until now.\nTwo weeks ago I created a new certificate valid from 27/09/2013 until 26/09/2018.\nWhen I click Resign option, I get \"Package successfully resigned\", but when I go to properties file (http://avenzoar/Content/43/A24021D17E882C46A5949EE2071B8BFD5D474143.cab) the certificate remains the same, the old certificate.\nHowever, if I try click on Revise option, Next, Next, Revise... then I get a new file (http://avenzoar/Content/70/A5CEB6312C7D01C23F6129CB03967A0F7259F770.cab) with the new certificate.\nThis way is the only one way I get resigned update. And I get another file, plus previos file. So finally I have two files in my WsusContent folder: the old file with old certificate, and the new file with new certificate. The old file is not deleted, so I must have to search it and clean up manually.\n\nI attach some screenshots.\n\nThanks!",
