I can't tell you how to detect if this software is already installed. You need to search these rule by your own.\nFor the \"IsInstallable\" rule, that depends of the enterprise Policy. Do you want to install this software on all computers ? On computers that already have a previous version of this software ? ...\n\n>  And the update file (setup.exe) which i selected also present in the folder, will it make any difference ?\n\nWPP will not let you do that. You can not have the same file twice in a folder.",
