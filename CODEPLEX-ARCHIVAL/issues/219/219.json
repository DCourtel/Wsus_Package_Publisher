    "Description": "Hello,\r\n\r\nVery new to WSUS PP, and have installed updates in the past without issue.  I just attempted to install the MSI's for Adobe Flash player 15.0.0.152 (AcitveX and Plugin Separately), however even systems without a previous version currently installed are attempting to install it, then failing.  I'm not completely understanding the rules, but in the past I never had to change any of the rules included with Adobe's MSI packages.  Here's what it includes: \r\n\r\nCheck for is already installed:\r\n\r\n<Start AND>\r\n<msiar:MsiProductInstalled ProductCode=\"{047904ba-c065-40d5-969a-c7d91ca93d62}\"/>\r\n<End AND>\r\n\r\nCheck for is installable:\r\n<Start AND>\r\n<lar:Not>\r\n<msiar:MsiProductInstalled ProductCode=\"{047904ba-c065-40d5-969a-c7d91ca93d62}\"/>\r\n</lar:Not>\r\n<End AND>\r\n\r\n\r\nCurious as to whats making it attempt to install even though it's not on some of the client systems.  Secondly, the second \"isInstallable\" rule must be working if it's failing every time.  I just don't want it to appear in the updates at all.\r\n\r\nHopefully someone could help.",
