    "Description": "Hello,\r\n\r\nIt appears that WPP can crash from time to time for no reason, and no error messages are shown after the crash. It only started to happen when I connect to the WSUS server on WPP, and after scrolling down the list of workstations, the program randomly crashes without reason.\r\n\r\nIs this something that can be fixed?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: This is no longer an issue as it fixed itself.\r\n ",
