Maybe add a new Option on context menu (reboot with timer...) and an Input window, or make it configurable within the Settings.\nBtw. it would be nice, to have the Option to customize the context menu. Actually I imagine activating only my most used Options and have a configurable Default Action on doubleclick in the computer-grid.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nRegards\nNorbert",
