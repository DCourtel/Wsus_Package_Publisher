    "Description": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI have a setup of an upstream WSUS where I installed WPP on the server to package and publish an Adobe update, and a downstream WSUS server that synchronizes from the upstream server.\r\n\r\nI can see the Adobe update listed in my upstream WSUS server (selected to make update visible in WSUS console), but I couldn't see the update listed in my downstream WSUS console. Since I do not install WPP in the downstream server, how do I make the update visible there? \r\n\r\nThank you.",
