    "Description": "I configured Symantec Endpoint for deployment via WSUS Package Publisher, everything worked fine but when I came back a few hours later the update is missing under the programs Updates directory. I see my Adobe packages but not the Symantec. I log into the WSUS console and I see them there. Please advise. \r\n\r\nIt would be hard to manage if the patches keep disappearing like that. \r\n\r\nWSUS - Server 2k12 datacenter. \r\nWSUS Package Publisher installed on local server. \r\nAble to push and successfully install packages. \r\n\r\nThanks, \r\nGary",
