    "Description": "Hi there,\r\n\r\nwhen i tried to create a certificate with WPP i got the error \"The directory name is invalid\",\r\nthe error also showed up when i tried to load an existing certificate.\r\n\r\nI checked my wpp directory and saw a new folder i did not create: \"my user name\"/appdata/local/temp\"\r\nLooks like WPP had a struggle finding the right temp folder...\r\n\r\nI solved the problem by creating the directory %windir%/system32/__windows/temp__ and  %windir%/system32/__windows/tmp__",
