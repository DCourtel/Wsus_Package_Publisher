    "Description": "Hello,\r\nthanks for this great tool first.\r\nI've got a question to the \"rename folders\"-function in the cutom updates generator of the WPP.\r\nI was trying to use the path variable %programfiles(x86)%\\folder\\folder to rename a folder, but this doesn't seem to work. If i use the absolute path c:\\program files (x86) it worked. I saw a using of variables like this in some WPP-pdf-document for the \"execute a file\"-function and so i thought they can be used to renam directorys too.",
