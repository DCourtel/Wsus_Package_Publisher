    "Description": "Good Afternoon,\r\n\r\n  I have been trying to find information on how use WPP to push out files to certain folders, or even push a folder with files to a workstation.  Our GPO, unfortunately is causing some issues with slowness on some items.\r\n\r\nHow, if possible, can you push a folder with files on a Workstation using WPP.\r\n\r\nAlso could you place new font files in the fonts folder using WPP?\r\n\r\nJust looking for other avenues other than GPO..  Thank you.\r\n\r\n~J",

In 7-Zip, save it as 7z archive format and put a check mark in the \"Create SFX archive\" box.\n\n2) When adding to WPP, make sure the command-line option is: -o\"c:\\Destination\\Directory\" -y\n\n3) Make sure the logic for detecting that the file is installed or needs to be upgraded works.\n\n4) Test to make sure you've not put the update into an endless loop.",
