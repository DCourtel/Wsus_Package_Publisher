      "Message": "Sorry for the slow reply, i was off for a couple of days.\nI'm pretty sure that i imported the certificate correctly. I had no problems on other computers that i configured manually. \nThe problem seems to be solved at the moment. I disabled updating from wsus, did a reboot, did a check for updates, enabled updating from wsus, did a reboot, check for updates and then the Flash update succeeded. The first time i did these steps the update still gave an error but the second time it worked.\n\nThanks for your time and your help!",
