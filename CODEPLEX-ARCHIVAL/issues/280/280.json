    "Description": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI set an update as prerequisite for another update. To be exactly I set NET.Framework as prerequisite for paint.net, mainly for testing purposes.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the NET.Framework update had a small bug. The package installed correctly and NET.Framework also worked. But in Windows Update the Update was displayed in some cases as failed. So I wanted to fix this issue what meaned that I had to create the update new from the beginning.\r\n\r\nI removed the prerequisite setting in the paint.net update. But i still could not delete the NET.Framework update. WPP stated that the NET.Framework package is still added as prerequisite in another package.\r\n\r\nWhen I tried to display that particular package WPP showed me only an emtpy list. I also verified that the paint.net package has not set any prerequisite.\r\n\r\nTo fix this I firstly had to delete the paint.net package. Afterwards it was possible to delete the NET.Framework package and create it new.\r\n\r\n\r\nGreetings\r\n\r\nwilly",
