    "Description": "I have receive a \"debug info\" file from an anonymous user which try to load a file as a new certificat. When loading this certificat, Wsus throw an Exception \"The parameter is incorrect'.\r\nThe only way to reproduce this error was to rename a non pfx file as *.pfx.\r\n\r\nWsus can only accept pfx file as certificat.\r\nAdd security in the code to avoid a user to try importing a certificat from a remote computer without SSL connection. Add a check to verify the imported file.",

      "Message": "Hi, DCourtel,\nI think it was me who sent this anonymous debug info (really should have added my email address ...). I use certificates from my own CA and fiddled around with multiple .pfx files. After receiving the error I've thought about the PW for the files & after entering the right one evrything was fine.\n\nThis is what I expected when importing an existing certificate:\n- browse for & choose a saved .pfx file\n- enter PW\n- success (or failure with error description) \n\nAs you changed the order to enter PW in 1st place: why did you do this & can that be changed?\n\nTHX for your good work & regards\nJoerg \n\n",
