      "Message": "Hi, I can confirm that, despite the documentation of the \"RegSzToVersion\", if one of the four-part version string is greater than 65535, the rule is not properly evaluate.\nThis is in total contradiction with the definition schema. It's a bug in the Windows Update Agent implementation, and I can't fix it. I will update the documentation of WPP.\nYou will have to base your detection on another rule.",
