    "Description": "I know this has been talked about several times, but none of the other posts seem to be able to resolve my issue.  I have the update made, approved and it shows up on my machines, however it will not install.  In my custom update, I have it uninstalling several older versions of Java and then installing 8update40 via the exe file.  When Windows Update gets to that point, it fails with code fffc -which from what I've seen online means that a file couldn't be found.  However, the files are there, so I'm really not sure what's happening. \r\n\r\nThis seems like a great product, but I need help.  I have included my xml file as that was requested on another person's issue.\r\n\r\nAlso, is there a way to modify an update package rather than deleting it and starting over from scratch?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nDoug",
