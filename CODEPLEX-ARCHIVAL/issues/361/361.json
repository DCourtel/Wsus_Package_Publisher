    "Description": "Hi there,\r\n\r\nFor my testing i created some packages (FrontMotion, Acrobat DC). And i created it with same name for each (example \"Acrobat DC\") For some reason packages won't appear in WPP (???), but still in WSUS (I push it as rejected).\r\n\r\nThere is a way to clean my crappy entries ? How to check fine/crap entry in WPP ?\r\n\r\nAnother issue is that if i'm creating package, if i reload WPP, existing packages vanishing and the update section is empty... How can i do ?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot",
