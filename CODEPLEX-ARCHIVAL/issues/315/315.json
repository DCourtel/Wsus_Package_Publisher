Pls look in WSUS-FAQ No. 44, you find there a image where you can find the correct build number. http://wsus.de/faq Here is a link to image: http://www.wsus.de/images/wsus-version.png Your W2008R2 must have .274, install the updates the are listed in WSUS FAQ No. 44, after this, restart the whole Server and now, delete %windir%\\SoftwareDistribution Folder and restart the W10 Clients. Now try again.",
