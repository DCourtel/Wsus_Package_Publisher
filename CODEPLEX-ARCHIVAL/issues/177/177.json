I just followed [the guide](https://www.codeplex.com/Download?ProjectName=WsusPackagePublisher&DownloadId=691788) (except put in the Java 7u51 msi product codes, and added a folder delete step to delete the start menu shortcut folder).\nI used the exe files (NOT the msi files, as Oracle have stated that they do not support or recommend installing via msi - their exe does extra stuff to make it work)",
