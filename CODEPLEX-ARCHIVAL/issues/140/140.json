    "Description": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI installed WSUS with WID (Windows Internal Database) on a Windows Server 2012 (without R2). Anything is working, except I can not switch the updates to be visible in WSUS. It worked once after many tries, but usually I get this error message. see screenshot. Firewall is on by default with only the default rules after installing wsus active. But as WPP runs locally on the wsus, I don't think, that's an firewall issue. Connect locally is checked in the settings tab.\r\n\r\nAny hints on this?\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nNorbert\r\n",
