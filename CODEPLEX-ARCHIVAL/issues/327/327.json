    "Description": "Hello,\r\n\r\ntoday I tried to create and distribute a custom update (batch-file-execution) with version 1.3.1411.09. Creating the update worked, but installation on clients failed (error FFFC). So I downloaded the latest version 1.3.1511.15 and tried the same here. The update appears in WSUS correctly but is shown as inapplicable for the clients (consequently they don't get the update).\r\nIt was exactly the same procedure as I had done with the old version 1.3.1411.09.\r\nCan someone help me here? How can I execute batch-scripts via custom update (for uninstalling old Java versions)?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\ndocwaremf",

You can check it before with following trick:\n\nCreate the Batch, put in %windir%\\SoftwareDistribution. Create a scheduled Task, run this Task with User SYSTEM. If its running, the custom update within WPP must run too.",
