    "Description": "Hi,\r\n\r\nif you hit the command \"Clean SoftwareDistribution Folder\" and the folder is __already empty__ WPP shows within the status window \"__failed__\".\r\n\r\nThe command was not failed in this case - the folder was already empty. It will be much better if WPP shows \"__folder already empty__\" instead of \"failed\". If I see \"failed\" somewhere, I think that something goes wrong - but it does. __Confusing status output__.\r\n\r\nGreetings\r\nPurecut",
