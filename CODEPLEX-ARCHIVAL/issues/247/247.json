    "Description": "I get the following error when Wsus Package Publisher starts on my Windows 8.1 workstation \"Server version is different from console version. You won't be able to publish/revise updates.\"\r\n\r\nClicking help->about revealed:\r\nRelease: 1.3.1411.9\r\nServer Version: 6.3.9600.16384\r\nConsole Version: 6.3.9600.17477\r\n\r\nI have attached the screen dump.\r\n\r\nI did not get this error until I loaded Microsoft patch \"December 2014 update rollup for Windows RT 8.1, Windows 8.1, and Windows Server 2012 R2\" KB3013769 on the workstation.  Loading the same Microsoft patch  on the Windows 2012 R2 Wsus server did not fix the issue.  However Wsus Package Publisher runs fine on the server.\r\n\r\nFurther investigation revealed that Microsoft patch \"December 2014 update rollup for Windows RT 8.1, Windows 8.1, and Windows Server 2012 R2\" KB3013769 includes Microsoft patch \"Long wait to reset WSUS server when you import CSA files in Windows Server 2012 R2 or Windows Server 2012\" KB3013488.  This patch updates several Wsus files and may break the server version detection.\r\n",

I'm wondering if the patch was supposed to change the value on the server but didn't for some reason, or maybe it's not supposed to change the registry...
