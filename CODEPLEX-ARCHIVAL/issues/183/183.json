The address you can see beside the 'Folder' label, came from the Wsus API. This is what WSUS answer when WPP ask 'Where is the file for this Update ?'\nIf WPP show HTTP instead of HTTPS, this mean, you have a configuration problem into the Wsus server.\n\nDoes your clients computers successfully download Microsoft updates ?",
